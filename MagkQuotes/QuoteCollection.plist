			<string>I understand culture. I am the nucleus.</string>
			<string>If I don&apos;t scream, if I don&apos;t say something, then no one&apos;s going to say anything, you know?</string>
			<string>All I want is positive! All I want is dopeness! Why would you want to control that?</string>
			<string>I&apos;m a professional creative.</string>
			<string>I need to be able to give people more of what they want that is currently behind a glass.</string>
			<string>The passion is for people. The passion is for the 18-year-old version of myself. The passion is for the kids at my shows. I need to do more.</string>
			<string>The idea of Kanye and vanity are like, synonymous. But I&apos;ve put myself in a lot of places where a vain person wouldn&apos;t put themselves in. Like what&apos;s vanity about wearing a kilt?</string>
			<string>It&apos;s hard when people read things in a lot of different ways.</string>
			<string>I&apos;m the type of soul that likes to be in love and likes to be able to focus. And that inspires me.</string>
			<string>Any woman that you&apos;re in love with or that loves you is going to command a certain amount of, you know, energy. It&apos;s actually easier to focus, in some ways.</string>
			<string>Maybe 90% of the time it looks like I&apos;m not having a good time.</string>
			<string>I&apos;m always the one that&apos;s in a darker mood.</string>
			<string>I will completely bow to anybody I respect.</string>
			<string>...great art comes from great pain. But also I&apos;d say a bigger statement than that is: Great art comes from great artists.</string>
			<string>Creative output, you know, is just pain.</string>
			<string>I&apos;m forever the 35-year-old 5-year-old. I&apos;m forever the 5-year-old of something.</string>
			<string>Sometimes you don&apos;t even know when you&apos;re being compromised till after the fact, and that&apos;s what you regret.</string>
			<string>You know, even a Kanye West has compromised.</string>
			<string>I&apos;m like, the anti-celebrity, and my music comes from a place of being anti.</string>
			<string>I don&apos;t have some type of romantic relationship with the public.</string>
			<string>My message isn&apos;t perfectly defined. I have, as a human being, fallen to peer pressure.</string>
			<string>I don&apos;t have one regret.</string>
			<string>...when you say justice, it doesn&apos;t have to be war. Justice could just be clearing a path for people to dream properly.</string>
			<string>They&apos;ll take any shot possible to try to take away the power of my influence and my words. But the proof is in the work.</string>
			<string>I&apos;m like a broadcaster for futurism, for dreamers, for people who believe in themselves.</string>
			<string>We&apos;ve been taught since day one to stop believing in our own dreams.</string>
			<string>Laugh loud, please. Laugh until your lungs give out because I will have the last laugh.</string>
			<string>I need belief more than I need advice.</string>
			<string>It&apos;s not a matter of me believing in myself that&apos;s so scary to everyone, it&apos;s the idea of everyone else starting to believe in themselves just as much as I do that&apos;s scary.</string>
			<string>...the biggest slavery that we have is our opinion of ourselves.</string>
			<string>I&apos;m not saying that I&apos;m going to make a better world; I&apos;m just saying that I will provide some things that will help, and my glass ceiling that I&apos;m facing is based on my color.</string>
			<string>My mission is about what I want to create. It&apos;s for people, for humanity. It&apos;s about things that can make the world better.</string>
			<string>I just want to create more.</string>
			<string>...influence isn&apos;t my definition of success - it&apos;s a by-product of my creativity.</string>
			<string>...success, for me, is in having the ability to get my ideas out there.</string>
			<string>You know, becoming famous is like being catapulted into space - sometimes without a space suit.</string>
			<string>...when we talk about love, I don&apos;t have an answer. All I can say is that I&apos;m happy I have it.</string>
			<string>Love... Well, if someone has got all the money in the world, they&apos;d still want love.</string>
			<string>My type of bedtime stories dealt with things like the nose being knocked off the Sphinx...</string>
			<string>I want the power to create what is in my mind. That&apos;s my dream.</string>
			<string>I mean, look, it took some time for us to be comfortable with a walking, talking mouse, but that became an icon.</string>
			<string>I think there&apos;s something kind of depressing about a product being final, because the only time a product is really final is when you&apos;re in a casket.</string>
			<string>If the waves are high, then we&apos;re gonna have a fun day. If the waves are low, then you just stay on the beach.</string>
			<string>The risk for me would be in not taking one - that&apos;s the only thing that&apos;s really risky for me.</string>
			<string>Well, all we have is today. You know, the past is gone, and tomorrow is not promised.</string>
			<string>A lot of people are very scared with their ideas, and there is something to protecting yourself in that way...</string>
			<string>I&apos;m giving all that I have in this life.</string>
			<string>I try to get as close to a childlike level as possible because we were all artists back then.</string>
			<string>Our focus needs to be less on what our legacy&apos;s going to be or how we can control each other and more how we can give to each other.</string>
			<string>Every time I crash the Internet, it&apos;s like this little drop of truth.</string>
			<string>When humanity&apos;s gone, what do we give to this little planet that we&apos;re on, and what could we do collectively, removing the pride?</string>

		<key>quotes</key>
		<array>
			<string>I want to stay hopeful, even though I get scared about why we&apos;re even alive at all.</string>
			<string>I have a personal ambition to live my life honestly and honor the true love that I&apos;ve had and also the people I&apos;ve had around me.</string>
			<string>I&apos;m a very happy person, but life is hard sometimes, and relationships are shit sometimes.</string>
			<string>Having a simple career as a musician who liked music was good enough for me.</string>
			<string>I knew that it takes getting everything you ever wanted and then losing it to know what true freedom is.</string>
			<string>Feeling like you&apos;re respected among the people who do the same thing you do is incredible and necessary.</string>
			<string>Do you know what makes you stronger? When people treat you and your art with dignity.</string>
			<string>Read books, pick your role models wisely. Find out what they did and do it.</string>
			<string>I used to wonder if it was God&apos;s plan that I should be alone for so much of my life. But I found peace.</string>
			<string>Live fast. Die young. Be wild. Have fun.</string>
			<string>I was always an unusual girl. My mother told me I had a chameleon soul...</string>
			<string>Are you in touch with all of your darkest fantasies? Have you created a life for yourself where you can experience them?</string>
			<string>When you&apos;re an introvert like me and you&apos;ve been lonely for a while, and then you find someone who understands you, you become really attached to them. It&apos;s a real release.</string>
			<string>I love going to the ocean. I love driving. I love going to shows. Just being with people I really have fun with.</string>
			<string>I love the summer. I&apos;m happy in the summer.</string>
			<string>I sort of have an affinity for really good, strong, self-assured people.</string>
			<string>...I have success because I&apos;m at peace and I&apos;m a good person in my everyday life and that&apos;s important.</string>
			<string>It&apos;s not nice to live in fear. That&apos;s part of the goal. Not being afraid of what&apos;s happening to you.</string>
			<string>Creatively I&apos;m in charge, if I wasn&apos;t, I would stop.</string>
			<string>I sort of do what I say and say what I do which I&apos;m happy with because it makes my life real easy.</string>
			<string>I believe nothing happens by mistake. You know, the universe has a divine plan.</string>
			<string>Curiosity is good.</string>
			<string>When you love your child, you don&apos;t know what to do with someone who wants to do what no one else does successfully.</string>
			<string>I was always a singer, it was nothing anyone planned on me doing for real, because it&apos;s an unusual thing.</string>
			<string>I was a different sort of child, as half the children are.</string>
			<string>Everything else is so hard; hopefully love is the one thing that is actually fun.</string>
			<string>If people come and see you at a show for 80 minutes they literally know everything about you.</string>
			<string>I relate to being the person who people come to for &apos;such a change from the old routine,&apos; but not being the main thing.</string>
			<string>It&apos;s a shame about the health consequences because a lot of great things happen over a coffee and a cigarette.</string>
			<string>If there&apos;s a physicality and a chemistry, that ends up winning for me every time because it&apos;s the opposite of what I have every day.</string>
			<string>I like a tangible, passionate love. For me, if it isn&apos;t physical, I&apos;m not interested.</string>
			<string>I like that two worlds can live in one.</string>
			<string>My goal is to be a good person who lives with dignity and grace.</string>

			<string>The day I wake up without cellulite? Now that would be the perfect day.</string>
			<string>I have friends from rock stars to Rastas; I don&apos;t even know what an unexpected friend is at this point.</string>
			<string>The way I dress depends on how I feel. I never have to psych myself up. Usually it just feels like it works.</string>
			<string>I am very ambitious! It&apos;s ridiculous how much I want to put on my plate, which is already full.</string>
			<string>...I tend to be more sensitive toward others and what they&apos;re going through. I don&apos;t know if that&apos;s the healthiest thing, but it&apos;s the truth.</string>
			<string>When you give God complete control, it&apos;s very hard not to be fearless.</string>
			<string>I try my best to avoid the sharks of life, but I have had my share of experiences with them, and in those cases I just have to handle them accordingly.</string>
			<string>Fashion is a clear indication, a way to express your attitude, your mood.</string>
			<string>When it feels like it&apos;s yours and it feels like it&apos;s you, that&apos;s what works.</string>
			<string>...a lot of the decisions I make, a lot of the direction I want to move, is against the grain, or against society&apos;s tight lane...</string>
			<string>You will never be stylish if you don&apos;t take risks.</string>
			<string>I love singing. I love it, and it doesn&apos;t feel like a chore. It&apos;s an expression.</string>
			<string>I never wanted to be famous. I just wanted my music to be heard all over the world.</string>
			<string>Fuck bitches, get money!</string>
			<string>The life of Rihanna is pretty fuckin&apos; awesome.</string>
			<string>Music is like shopping for me. Every song is like a new pair of shoes.</string>
			<string>I&apos;m crazy, and I don&apos;t pretend to be anything else.</string>
			<string>I like to take charge, but I love to be submissive.</string>
			<string>It&apos;s 4:20 somewhere.</string>
			<string>Seriously, all I want is a guy to take me out and make me laugh for a good hour and take my ass back home.</string>
			<string>If I dress too sexy, then I&apos;m a slut; if I dress sophisticated, then I&apos;m a grandma. At the end of the day, I just wear what I want to wear.</string>
			<string>...if I want to wear it, I will.</string>
			<string>For me, it&apos;s tougher to be vulnerable than to be tough.</string>
			<string>My first kiss was in high school, and it was the worst thing ever.</string>
			<string>I&apos;m waiting for the man who&apos;s ballsy enough to deal with me.</string>
			<string>To me, sex is power. It&apos;s empowering when you do it because you want to do it.</string>
			<string>I had to fake it till I made it.</string>
			<string>...I&apos;m not gonna ever crash. I&apos;m in control.</string>
			<string>I&apos;m open to love. But guys should have to earn it.</string>
			<string>I want to be the black Madonna.</string>
			<string>Alcohol is the devil and I need Chinese food.</string>
			<string>I never know what day it is. Never, ever, ever.</string>

			<string>A lot of the time you walk in a room they already know what they want to write about you.</string>
			<string>Actors do like watching girls parade down the runway for some reason.</string>
			<string>When people see an actor speak, they think they know him or her, whereas I&apos;m just a face or a body to them.</string>
			<string>Americans are really obsessed with their teeth being white and straight, aren&apos;t they?</string>
			<string>I feel like I&apos;m being judged a lot of the time.</string>
			<string>You should always be asleep on a plane.</string>
			<string>It&apos;s all about the blanket. Blanket, pillow, and red wine.</string>
			<string>It is quite amazing what I didn&apos;t feel after a while. I didn&apos;t really want to feel things.</string>
			<string>I thought it was quite vain to say, I want to be a model.</string>
			<string>I want to live my life in a way that when I get really old, I look back at my life and say: aaah I lived it, not survived it.</string>
			<string>People think your success is just a matter of having a pretty face. But it&apos;s easy to be chewed up and spat out.</string>
			<string>You&apos;ve got to stay ahead of the game to be able to stay in it.</string>
			<string>I have met almost everyone I&apos;ve wanted to meet.</string>
			<string>I thought we might all burst into flames, all the crap we&apos;ve done.</string>
			<string>I&apos;m not going to be horrible just for the sake of having attitude or make other people feel small just to make me feel bigger.</string>
			<string>I don&apos;t want people to know what is true all the time and that&apos;s what keeps the mystery.</string>
			<string>I&apos;ve been blamed for everything, from smoking to heroin to anorexia.</string>
			<string>I didn&apos;t like my teeth. I didn&apos;t like my flat chest, either.</string>
			<string>It was kind of boring for me to have to eat.</string>
			<string>I don&apos;t like doing pictures as myself. I like to be made into someone else.</string>
			<string>Never complain. Never explain.</string>
			<string>Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels.</string>
			<string>People don&apos;t hear me talk. They don&apos;t expect me to.</string>
			<string>I like feeling that I&apos;ve nailed it, and we&apos;ve got the picture.</string>
			<string>I have made some of the best friends that I&apos;ve got in this business.</string>
			<string>It sounds really corny but I think if you&apos;re beautiful inside it shows on the outside, for sure.</string>
			<string>You can&apos;t do a dog in a heel.</string>
			<string>I got tired of feeling like Dracula. I wanted to see some daylight, and not just at six o&apos;clock in the morning.</string>
			<string>Yeah, I like clothes, but I hardly ever go shopping.</string>
			<string>I haven&apos;t partied since... last Friday!</string>
			<string>It&apos;s a sin to be tired.</string>
			<string>Going to the gym wouldn&apos;t be on my list of favorite things to do.</string>
			<string>I never did a dirty armpit. You can look dirty, but you can&apos;t be dirty.</string>
