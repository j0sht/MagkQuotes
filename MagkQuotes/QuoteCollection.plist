			<string>You are free only in one sense: free from education in governing your life yourself, free from self-criticism. </string>
			<string>See yourself as you really are...Don&apos;t run. Have the courage to look at yourself!</string>
			<string>Only you yourself can be your liberator!</string>
			<string>Don&apos;t run away. Don&apos;t be afraid. It is not so terrible to be the responsible bearer of human society.</string>
			<string>Follow the voice of your heart, even if it leads you off the path of timid souls.</string>
			<string>There is only one thing that counts: to live one&apos;s life well and happily...</string>
			<string>Your life will be good and secure when aliveness means more to you than security.</string>
			<string>Love, work, and knowledge are the well-springs of our life. They should also govern it.</string>
			<string>Only the liberation of the natural capacity for love in human beings can master their sadistic destructiveness.</string>
			<string>Scientific theory is a contrived foothold in the chaos of living phenomena.</string>
			<string>On all sides, life is surrounded by hostility.</string>
			<string>It is on your thinking and your actions that the future of humanity depends.</string>

		<array>
			<string>If power asks why, then power is weakness.</string>
			<string>...in the absence of will power, the most complete collection of virtues and talents is wholly worthless.</string>
			<string>It is necessary, in this world, to be made of harder stuff than one&apos;s environment.</string>
			<string>The ordinary man looking at a mountain is like an illiterate person confronted with a Greek manuscript.</string>
			<string>My own plan is to swear off every kind of virtue, so that I triumph even when I fall!</string>
			<string>May the New Year bring you courage to break your resolutions early!</string>
			<string>Love is the law, love under will.</string>
			<string>I&apos;ve a strange feeling come over me - almost as if I were going to think!</string>
			<string>The Way of Mastery is to break all the rules - but you have to know them perfectly before you can do this; otherwise you are not in a position to transcend them.</string>
			<string>Since all things are God, in all things thou seest just so much of God as thy capacity affordeth thee.</string>
			<string>I was not content to believe in a personal devil and serve him, in the ordinary sense of the word. I wanted to get a hold of him personally and become his chief of staff.</string>
			<string>No one has yet invented a language from my point of view.</string>
			<string>I hardly ever talk - words seem such a waste, and they are none of them true.</string>
			<string>What the eye doesn&apos;t see, the heart doesn&apos;t grieve over.</string>
			<string>Every man and every woman is a star.</string>
			<string>...pure will, unassuaged of purpose, delivered from the lust of result, is every way perfect.</string>
			<string>I&apos;ve written this to keep from crying. But I am crying, only the tears won&apos;t come.</string>
			<string>I&apos;m a poet, and I like my lies the way my mother used to make them.</string>
			<string>Having to talk destroys the symphony of silence.</string>
			<string>Your kiss is bitter with cocaine.</string>
			<string>Science is always discovering odd scraps of magical wisdom and making a tremendous fuss about its cleverness.</string>
			<string>Ordinary morality is only for ordinary people.</string>
			<string>Magick is the science and art of causing change to occur in conformity with will.</string>
			<string>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</string>
			<string>The sin which is unpardonable is knowingly and willfully to reject truth, to fear knowledge lest that knowledge pander not to thy prejudices.</string>
			<string>The essence of independence has been to think and act according to standards from within, not without.</string>
			<string>If enough people come to agree with, and follow, the Rebel, we now have a Devil. Until, of course, still more people agree. And then, finally, we have - Greatness.</string>
			<string>Inevitably, anyone with an independent mind must become &apos;one who resists or opposes authority or established conventions&apos;: a rebel.</string>

			<string>Arousal leaves us mind-blind.</string>
			<string>Working really hard is what successful people do...</string>
			<string>There are exceptional people out there who are capable of starting epidemics. All you have to do is find them.</string>
			<string>We need to look at the subtle, the hidden, and the unspoken.</string>
			<string>Courage is what you earn when you&apos;ve been through the tough times and you discover they aren&apos;t so tough after all.</string>
			<string>There can be as much value in the blink of an eye as in months of rational analysis.</string>
			<string>When we become expert in something, our tastes grow more esoteric and complex.</string>
			<string>Cultural legacies are powerful forces. They have deep roots and long lives.</string>
			<string>Hard work is a prison sentence only if it does not have meaning.</string>
			<string>In the act of tearing something apart, you lose its meaning.</string>
			<string>Emotion is contagious.</string>
			<string>Caring about someone deeply is exhausting.</string>
			<string>To be someone&apos;s best friend requires a minimum investment of time. More than that, though, its takes emotional energy.</string>
			<string>No one who can rise before dawn three hundred and sixty days a year fails to make his family rich.</string>
			<string>Achievement is talent plus preparation.</string>
			<string>Who we are cannot be separated from where we&apos;re from.</string>
			<string>Practice isn&apos;t the thing you do once you&apos;re good. It&apos;s the thing you do that makes you good.</string>

		<array>
			<string>Production: not a tree, but bushes of several roots mixed together.</string>
			<string>We struggle with dream figures and our blows fall on living faces.</string>
			<string>Everything is science and everything is philosophy.</string>
			<string>We are caught in a secret history, in a forest of symbols.</string>
			<string>The world and I are within one another.</string>
			<string>Expression is like a step taken in the fog - no one can say where, if anywhere, it will lead.</string>
			<string>History flows neither from the past nor to the future alone: it reverses its course and, when you get right down to it, flows from all the presents.</string>
			<string>If this world is a poem, it is not because we see the meaning of it at first but on the strength of its chance occurences and paradoxes.</string>
			<string>I will never know how you see red and you will never know how I see it.</string>
			<string>To ask for an explanation is to explain the obscure by the more obscure.</string>
			<string>The flesh is at the heart of the world.</string>
			<string>Science manipulates things and gives up living in them.</string>
			<string>Philosophy is not the reflection of a pre-existing truth, but, like art, the act of bringing truth into being.</string>
			<string>Language transcends us and yet we speak.</string>
			<string>It is the essence of certainty to be established only with reservations.</string>
			<string>We know not through our intellect but through our experience.</string>
			<string>The body is our general medium for having a world.</string>

		<array>
			<string>The purpose of a writer is to keep civilization from destroying itself.</string>
			<string>I may not have been sure about what really did interest me, but I was absolutely sure about what didn&apos;t.</string>
			<string>I opened myself to the gentle indifference of the world.</string>
			<string>At the heart of all beauty lies something inhuman.</string>
			<string>Always go too far, because that&apos;s where you&apos;ll find the truth.</string>
			<string>In order to understand the world, one has to turn away from it on occasion.</string>
			<string>Do not wait for the last judgement. It comes every day.</string>
			<string>People hasten to judge in order not to be judged themselves.</string>
			<string>Man is always prey to his truths. Once he has admitted them, he cannot free himself from them.</string>
			<string>In the midst of chaos, I found there was, within me, an invincible calm.</string>
			<string>There is not love of life without despair about life.</string>
			<string>Seeking what is true is not seeking what is desirable.</string>
			<string>Some people talk in their sleep. Lecturers talk while other people sleep.</string>
			<string>Without beauty, love, or danger it would almost be easy to live.</string>
			<string>What is a rebel? A man who says no.</string>
			<string>Freedom is nothing but a chance to be better.</string>
			<string>Since we&apos;re all going to die, it&apos;s obvious that when and how don&apos;t matter.</string>
			<string>If something is going to happen to me, I want to be there.</string>
			<string>You can&apos;t create experience, you undergo it.</string>
			<string>There is scarcely any passion without struggle.</string>
			<string>What is called a reason for living is also an excellent reason for dying.</string>
			<string>We are all special cases.</string>
			<string>Where there is no hope, it is incumbent on us to invent it.</string>
			<string>I rebel; therefore I exist.</string>
			<string>Beauty is unbearable, drives us to despair, offering us for a minute the glimpse of an eternity that we should like to stretch out over the whole of time.</string>
			<string>Fiction is the lie through which we tell the truth.</string>
			<string>Autumn is a second spring when every leaf is a flower.</string>
			<string>To be happy, we must not be too concerned with others.</string>
			<string>An intellectual is someone whose mind watches itself.</string>
			<string>Blessed are the hearts that can bend; they shall never be broken.</string>
			<string>Real generosity towards the future lies in giving all to the present.</string>
			<string>When I look at my life and its secret colors, I feel like bursting into tears.</string>
			<string>The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion.</string>
			<string>You know what charm is: a way of getting the answer yes without having asked any clear questions.</string>
			<string>Live to the point of tears.</string>
			<string>Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?</string>
			<string>Nobody realizes that some people expend tremendous energy merely to be normal.</string>
			<string>Man is the only creature who refuses to be what he is.</string>
			<string>In the depths of winter, I finally learned that within me there lay an invincible summer.</string>
			<string>You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life.</string>
			<string>You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of.</string>
			<string>Don&apos;t walk behind me; I may not lead. Don&apos;t walk in front of me; I may not follow. Just walk beside me and be my friend.</string>

			<string>Boldness has genius, power and magic in it!</string>
			<string>One ought, every day at least, to hear a little song, read a good poem, see a fine picture, and... speak a few reasonable words.</string>
			<string>As soon as you trust yourself, you will know how to live.</string>
			<string>...our planet is the mental institution of the universe.</string>
			<string>I bid the chords sweet music make, And all must follow in my wake.</string>
			<string>A man sees in the world what he carries in his heart.</string>
			<string>Know thyself? If I knew myself, I&apos;d run away.</string>
			<string>None are more hopelessly enslaved as those who falsely believe they are free.</string>
			<string>To think is easy. To act is hard. But the hardest thing in the world is to act in accordance with your thinking.</string>
			<string>Nothing shows a man&apos;s character more than what he laughs at.</string>
			<string>By seeking and blundering we learn.</string>
			<string>A person hears only what they understand.</string>
			<string>Life belongs to the living, and he who lives must be prepared for changes.</string>
			<string>Magic is believing in yourself, if you can do that, you can make anything happen.</string>
			<string>Things which matter most must never be at the mercy of things which matter least.</string>
			<string>I love those who yearn for the impossible.</string>
			<string>Nothing is worth more than this day.</string>
			<string>Knowing is not enough; we must apply. Willing is not enough; we must do.</string>
			<string>Instruction does much, but encouragement everything.</string>
			<string>Enjoy when you can, and endure when you must.</string>
			<string>All the knowledge I possess everyone else can acquire, but my heart is all my own.</string>
			<string>Age does not make us childish, as some say; it finds us true children.</string>
			<string>We are shaped and fashioned by what we love.</string>
			<string>Be bold and mighty forces will come to your aid.</string>
			<string>The greatest thing in this world is not so much where we stand as in what direction we are moving.</string>
			<string>We must always change, renew, rejuvenate ourselves; otherwise, we harden.</string>
			<string>Everything is hard before it is easy.</string>
			<string>We are our own devils; we drive ourselves out of our Edens.</string>
			<string>Divide and rule, a sound motto. Unite and lead, a better one.</string>
			<string>People who think honestly and deeply have a hostile attitude towards the public.</string>
			<string>If you don&apos;t feel it, you&apos;ll never get it.</string>
			<string>At the moment of commitment, the entire universe conspires to assist you.</string>
			<string>Talent develops itself in solitude; character in the stream of life.</string>
			<string>There is strong shadow where there is much light.</string>
			<string>Music is liquid architecture; Architecture is frozen music.</string>
			<string>If you would create something, you must be something.</string>
			<string>Dream no small dreams for they have no power to move the hearts of men.</string>
			<string>Difficulties increase the nearer we get to the goal.</string>
			<string>The soul that sees beauty may sometimes walk alone.</string>
			<string>We are never deceived; we deceive ourselves.</string>
			<string>Choose well, your choice is brief, and yet endless.</string>
			<string>God help us - for art is long, and life so short.</string>
			<string>We know accurately only when we know little, with knowledge doubt increases.</string>
			<string>Love does not dominate; it cultivates.</string>
			<string>There is nothing more dreadful than imagination without taste.</string>
			<string>Night is the other half of life, and the better half.</string>
			<string>The intelligent man finds almost everything ridiculous, the sensible man hardly anything.</string>
			<string>Doubt can only be removed by action.</string>
			<string>Too many parents make life hard for their children by trying, too zealously, to make it easy for them.</string>
			<string>The greatest evil that can befall man is that he should come to think ill of himself.</string>

			<string>Beauty is no quality in things themselves: It exists merely in the mind which contemplates them; and each mind perceives a different beauty.</string>
			<string>Generally speaking, the errors in religion are dangerous; those in philosophy only ridiculous.</string>
			<string>No man ever threw away life while it was worth keeping.</string>
			<string>Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of passions.</string>
			<string>Reading and sauntering and lounging and dosing, which I call thinking, is my supreme happiness.</string>
			<string>The truth springs from arguments amongst friends.</string>
			<string>He is happy whose circumstances suit his temper, but he is more excellent who can suit his temper to his circumstances.</string>
			<string>The life of man is of no greater importance to the universe than that of an oyster.</string>
			<string>From what causes do I derive my existence, and to what condition shall I return?</string>
			<string>Liberty of any kind is never lost all at once.</string>
			<string>Heaven and Hell suppose two distinct species of men, the Good and the Bad. But the greatest part of mankind float betwixt vice and virtue.</string>
			<string>The sweetest and most inoffensive path of life leads through the avenues of science and learning...</string>
			<string>To philosopher and historian the madness and imbecile wickedness of mankind ought to appear ordinary events.</string>
			<string>A purpose, an intention, a design, strikes every where the most careless, the most stupid thinker.</string>
			<string>...it is possible for the same thing both to be and not to be.</string>

			<string>It&apos;s hard when people read things in a lot of different ways.</string>
			<string>I&apos;m the type of soul that likes to be in love and likes to be able to focus. And that inspires me.</string>
			<string>Any woman that you&apos;re in love with or that loves you is going to command a certain amount of, you know, energy. It&apos;s actually easier to focus, in some ways.</string>
			<string>Maybe 90% of the time it looks like I&apos;m not having a good time.</string>
			<string>I&apos;m always the one that&apos;s in a darker mood.</string>
			<string>I will completely bow to anybody I respect.</string>
			<string>...great art comes from great pain. But also I&apos;d say a bigger statement than that is: Great art comes from great artists.</string>
			<string>Creative output, you know, is just pain.</string>
			<string>I&apos;m forever the 35-year-old 5-year-old. I&apos;m forever the 5-year-old of something.</string>
			<string>Sometimes you don&apos;t even know when you&apos;re being compromised till after the fact, and that&apos;s what you regret.</string>
			<string>You know, even a Kanye West has compromised.</string>
			<string>I&apos;m like, the anti-celebrity, and my music comes from a place of being anti.</string>
			<string>I don&apos;t have some type of romantic relationship with the public.</string>
			<string>My message isn&apos;t perfectly defined. I have, as a human being, fallen to peer pressure.</string>
			<string>I don&apos;t have one regret.</string>
			<string>...when you say justice, it doesn&apos;t have to be war. Justice could just be clearing a path for people to dream properly.</string>
			<string>They&apos;ll take any shot possible to try to take away the power of my influence and my words. But the proof is in the work.</string>
			<string>I&apos;m like a broadcaster for futurism, for dreamers, for people who believe in themselves.</string>
			<string>We&apos;ve been taught since day one to stop believing in our own dreams.</string>
			<string>Laugh loud, please. Laugh until your lungs give out because I will have the last laugh.</string>
			<string>I need belief more than I need advice.</string>
			<string>It&apos;s not a matter of me believing in myself that&apos;s so scary to everyone, it&apos;s the idea of everyone else starting to believe in themselves just as much as I do that&apos;s scary.</string>
			<string>...the biggest slavery that we have is our opinion of ourselves.</string>
			<string>I&apos;m not saying that I&apos;m going to make a better world; I&apos;m just saying that I will provide some things that will help, and my glass ceiling that I&apos;m facing is based on my color.</string>
			<string>My mission is about what I want to create. It&apos;s for people, for humanity. It&apos;s about things that can make the world better.</string>
			<string>I just want to create more.</string>
			<string>...influence isn&apos;t my definition of success - it&apos;s a by-product of my creativity.</string>
			<string>...success, for me, is in having the ability to get my ideas out there.</string>
			<string>You know, becoming famous is like being catapulted into space - sometimes without a space suit.</string>
			<string>...when we talk about love, I don&apos;t have an answer. All I can say is that I&apos;m happy I have it.</string>
			<string>Love... Well, if someone has got all the money in the world, they&apos;d still want love.</string>
			<string>My type of bedtime stories dealt with things like the nose being knocked off the Sphinx...</string>
			<string>I want the power to create what is in my mind. That&apos;s my dream.</string>
			<string>I mean, look, it took some time for us to be comfortable with a walking, talking mouse, but that became an icon.</string>
			<string>I think there&apos;s something kind of depressing about a product being final, because the only time a product is really final is when you&apos;re in a casket.</string>
			<string>If the waves are high, then we&apos;re gonna have a fun day. If the waves are low, then you just stay on the beach.</string>
			<string>The risk for me would be in not taking one - that&apos;s the only thing that&apos;s really risky for me.</string>
			<string>Well, all we have is today. You know, the past is gone, and tomorrow is not promised.</string>
			<string>A lot of people are very scared with their ideas, and there is something to protecting yourself in that way...</string>
			<string>I&apos;m giving all that I have in this life.</string>
			<string>I try to get as close to a childlike level as possible because we were all artists back then.</string>
			<string>Our focus needs to be less on what our legacy&apos;s going to be or how we can control each other and more how we can give to each other.</string>
			<string>Every time I crash the Internet, it&apos;s like this little drop of truth.</string>
			<string>When humanity&apos;s gone, what do we give to this little planet that we&apos;re on, and what could we do collectively, removing the pride?</string>

			<string>I want to stay hopeful, even though I get scared about why we&apos;re even alive at all.</string>
			<string>I have a personal ambition to live my life honestly and honor the true love that I&apos;ve had and also the people I&apos;ve had around me.</string>
			<string>I&apos;m a very happy person, but life is hard sometimes, and relationships are shit sometimes.</string>
			<string>Having a simple career as a musician who liked music was good enough for me.</string>
			<string>I knew that it takes getting everything you ever wanted and then losing it to know what true freedom is.</string>
			<string>Feeling like you&apos;re respected among the people who do the same thing you do is incredible and necessary.</string>
			<string>Do you know what makes you stronger? When people treat you and your art with dignity.</string>
			<string>Read books, pick your role models wisely. Find out what they did and do it.</string>
			<string>I used to wonder if it was God&apos;s plan that I should be alone for so much of my life. But I found peace.</string>
			<string>Live fast. Die young. Be wild. Have fun.</string>
			<string>I was always an unusual girl. My mother told me I had a chameleon soul...</string>
			<string>Are you in touch with all of your darkest fantasies? Have you created a life for yourself where you can experience them?</string>
			<string>When you&apos;re an introvert like me and you&apos;ve been lonely for a while, and then you find someone who understands you, you become really attached to them. It&apos;s a real release.</string>
			<string>I love going to the ocean. I love driving. I love going to shows. Just being with people I really have fun with.</string>
			<string>I love the summer. I&apos;m happy in the summer.</string>
			<string>I sort of have an affinity for really good, strong, self-assured people.</string>
			<string>...I have success because I&apos;m at peace and I&apos;m a good person in my everyday life and that&apos;s important.</string>
			<string>It&apos;s not nice to live in fear. That&apos;s part of the goal. Not being afraid of what&apos;s happening to you.</string>
			<string>Creatively I&apos;m in charge, if I wasn&apos;t, I would stop.</string>
			<string>I sort of do what I say and say what I do which I&apos;m happy with because it makes my life real easy.</string>
			<string>I believe nothing happens by mistake. You know, the universe has a divine plan.</string>
			<string>Curiosity is good.</string>
			<string>When you love your child, you don&apos;t know what to do with someone who wants to do what no one else does successfully.</string>
			<string>I was always a singer, it was nothing anyone planned on me doing for real, because it&apos;s an unusual thing.</string>
			<string>I was a different sort of child, as half the children are.</string>
			<string>Everything else is so hard; hopefully love is the one thing that is actually fun.</string>
			<string>If people come and see you at a show for 80 minutes they literally know everything about you.</string>
			<string>I relate to being the person who people come to for &apos;such a change from the old routine,&apos; but not being the main thing.</string>
			<string>It&apos;s a shame about the health consequences because a lot of great things happen over a coffee and a cigarette.</string>
			<string>If there&apos;s a physicality and a chemistry, that ends up winning for me every time because it&apos;s the opposite of what I have every day.</string>
			<string>I like a tangible, passionate love. For me, if it isn&apos;t physical, I&apos;m not interested.</string>
			<string>I like that two worlds can live in one.</string>
			<string>My goal is to be a good person who lives with dignity and grace.</string>

			<string>The day I wake up without cellulite? Now that would be the perfect day.</string>
			<string>I have friends from rock stars to Rastas; I don&apos;t even know what an unexpected friend is at this point.</string>
			<string>The way I dress depends on how I feel. I never have to psych myself up. Usually it just feels like it works.</string>
			<string>I am very ambitious! It&apos;s ridiculous how much I want to put on my plate, which is already full.</string>
			<string>...I tend to be more sensitive toward others and what they&apos;re going through. I don&apos;t know if that&apos;s the healthiest thing, but it&apos;s the truth.</string>
			<string>When you give God complete control, it&apos;s very hard not to be fearless.</string>
			<string>I try my best to avoid the sharks of life, but I have had my share of experiences with them, and in those cases I just have to handle them accordingly.</string>
			<string>Fashion is a clear indication, a way to express your attitude, your mood.</string>
			<string>When it feels like it&apos;s yours and it feels like it&apos;s you, that&apos;s what works.</string>
			<string>...a lot of the decisions I make, a lot of the direction I want to move, is against the grain, or against society&apos;s tight lane...</string>
			<string>You will never be stylish if you don&apos;t take risks.</string>
			<string>I love singing. I love it, and it doesn&apos;t feel like a chore. It&apos;s an expression.</string>
			<string>I never wanted to be famous. I just wanted my music to be heard all over the world.</string>
			<string>Fuck bitches, get money!</string>
			<string>The life of Rihanna is pretty fuckin&apos; awesome.</string>
			<string>Music is like shopping for me. Every song is like a new pair of shoes.</string>
			<string>I&apos;m crazy, and I don&apos;t pretend to be anything else.</string>
			<string>I like to take charge, but I love to be submissive.</string>
			<string>It&apos;s 4:20 somewhere.</string>
			<string>Seriously, all I want is a guy to take me out and make me laugh for a good hour and take my ass back home.</string>
			<string>If I dress too sexy, then I&apos;m a slut; if I dress sophisticated, then I&apos;m a grandma. At the end of the day, I just wear what I want to wear.</string>
			<string>...if I want to wear it, I will.</string>
			<string>For me, it&apos;s tougher to be vulnerable than to be tough.</string>
			<string>My first kiss was in high school, and it was the worst thing ever.</string>
			<string>I&apos;m waiting for the man who&apos;s ballsy enough to deal with me.</string>
			<string>To me, sex is power. It&apos;s empowering when you do it because you want to do it.</string>
			<string>I had to fake it till I made it.</string>
			<string>...I&apos;m not gonna ever crash. I&apos;m in control.</string>
			<string>I&apos;m open to love. But guys should have to earn it.</string>
			<string>I want to be the black Madonna.</string>
			<string>Alcohol is the devil and I need Chinese food.</string>
			<string>I never know what day it is. Never, ever, ever.</string>

			<string>A lot of the time you walk in a room they already know what they want to write about you.</string>
			<string>Actors do like watching girls parade down the runway for some reason.</string>
			<string>When people see an actor speak, they think they know him or her, whereas I&apos;m just a face or a body to them.</string>
			<string>Americans are really obsessed with their teeth being white and straight, aren&apos;t they?</string>
			<string>I feel like I&apos;m being judged a lot of the time.</string>
			<string>You should always be asleep on a plane.</string>
			<string>It&apos;s all about the blanket. Blanket, pillow, and red wine.</string>
			<string>It is quite amazing what I didn&apos;t feel after a while. I didn&apos;t really want to feel things.</string>
			<string>I thought it was quite vain to say, I want to be a model.</string>
			<string>I want to live my life in a way that when I get really old, I look back at my life and say: aaah I lived it, not survived it.</string>
			<string>People think your success is just a matter of having a pretty face. But it&apos;s easy to be chewed up and spat out.</string>
			<string>You&apos;ve got to stay ahead of the game to be able to stay in it.</string>
			<string>I have met almost everyone I&apos;ve wanted to meet.</string>
			<string>I thought we might all burst into flames, all the crap we&apos;ve done.</string>
			<string>I&apos;m not going to be horrible just for the sake of having attitude or make other people feel small just to make me feel bigger.</string>
			<string>I don&apos;t want people to know what is true all the time and that&apos;s what keeps the mystery.</string>
			<string>I&apos;ve been blamed for everything, from smoking to heroin to anorexia.</string>
			<string>I didn&apos;t like my teeth. I didn&apos;t like my flat chest, either.</string>
			<string>It was kind of boring for me to have to eat.</string>
			<string>I don&apos;t like doing pictures as myself. I like to be made into someone else.</string>
			<string>Never complain. Never explain.</string>
			<string>Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels.</string>
			<string>People don&apos;t hear me talk. They don&apos;t expect me to.</string>
			<string>I like feeling that I&apos;ve nailed it, and we&apos;ve got the picture.</string>
			<string>I have made some of the best friends that I&apos;ve got in this business.</string>
			<string>It sounds really corny but I think if you&apos;re beautiful inside it shows on the outside, for sure.</string>
			<string>You can&apos;t do a dog in a heel.</string>
			<string>I got tired of feeling like Dracula. I wanted to see some daylight, and not just at six o&apos;clock in the morning.</string>
			<string>Yeah, I like clothes, but I hardly ever go shopping.</string>
			<string>I haven&apos;t partied since... last Friday!</string>
			<string>It&apos;s a sin to be tired.</string>
			<string>Going to the gym wouldn&apos;t be on my list of favorite things to do.</string>
			<string>I never did a dirty armpit. You can look dirty, but you can&apos;t be dirty.</string>
