			<string>I need a dance partner here - and the floor is empty.</string>
			<string>The presidency has a funny way of making a person feel the need to pray.</string>
			<string>Let&apos;s try common sense. A novel concept.</string>
			<string>Prosperity without freedom is just another form of poverty.</string>
			<string>Let us reach for the world that ought to be - that spark of the divine that still stirs within each of our souls.</string>
			<string>Only a just peace based on the inherent rights and dignity of every individual can truly be lasting. </string>
			<string>Peace requires responsibility. Peace entails sacrifice.</string>
			<string>...war itself is never glorious, and we must never trumpet it as such.</string>
			<string>We have the power to make the world we seek, but only if we have the courage to make a new beginning.</string>
			<string>All of us share this world for but a brief moment in time.</string>
			<string>All of us must recognize that that education and innovation will be the currency of the 21st Century.</string>
			<string>...our daughters can contribute just as much to society as our sons.</string>
			<string>A woman who is denied an education is denied equality.</string>
			<string>Suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away.</string>
			<string>Words alone cannot meet the needs of our people.</string>
			<string>...the interests we share as human beings are far more powerful than the forces that drive us apart.</string>
			<string>Together we can do it.</string>
			<string>Human destiny will be what we make of it.</string>
			<string>When we fail to pursue peace, then it stays forever beyond our grasp.</string>
			<string>...moral leadership is more powerful than any weapon.</string>
			<string>With hope and virtue, let us brave once more the icy currents, and endure what storms may come.</string>
			<string>...the world has changed, and we must change with it.</string>
			<string>...greatness is never a given. It must be earned.</string>
			<string>Each society must search for its own path, and no path is perfect.</string>
			<string>...while the future is unknowable, the winds always blow in the direction of human progress.</string>
			<string>The essential truth of democracy is that each nation determines its own destiny.</string>
			<string>Don&apos;t shortchange the future, because of fear in the present.</string>
			<string>We can shape our future, or let events shape it for us.</string>
			<string>True partnership and true progress requires constant work and sustained sacrifice.</string>
			<string>Contrary to the rumours that you&apos;ve heard, I was not born in a manger. I was actually born on Krypton...</string>
			<string>...here in America, our destiny is not written for us, but by us.</string>
			<string>The journey will be difficult. The road will be long.</string>
			<string>I am reminded every day of my life, if not by events, then by my wife, that I am not a perfect man.</string>
			<string>...true unity cannot be so easily won. It starts with a change in attitudes - a broadening of our minds, and a broadening of our hearts.</string>
			<string>...no matter what obstacles lie in our way, nothing can stand in the way of the power of millions of voices calling for change.</string>
			<string>Hope is that thing inside use that insists, despite all evidence to the contrary, the something better awaits us if we have the courage to reach for it...</string>
			<string>...it bothers me when I hear people say that government is the enemy. They don&apos;t understand its fundamental role.</string>
			<string>People who love their country can change it.</string>
			<string>...it&apos;s only when you hitch your wagon to something larger than yourself that you realize your true potential.</string>
			<string>Focusing your life solely on making a buck shows a certain poverty of ambition. It asks too little of yourself.</string>
			<string>Do we participate in a politics of cynicism or a politics of hope?</string>
			<string>That is the true genius of America, a faith in the simple dreams of its people, the insistence on small miracles.</string>
			<string>There is not a liberal America and a conservative America - there is a United States of America.</string>
			<string>A good compromise, a good piece of legislation, is like a good sentence; or a good piece of music. Everybody can recognize it.</string>
			<string>The suburbs bore me.</string>

			<string>When things get too heavy just call me helium...</string>
			<string>Not necessarily stoned, but beautiful.</string>
			<string>I don&apos;t really live on compliments. As a matter of fact, they have a way of distracting me.</string>
			<string>...there are so many sleeping people.</string>
			<string>We want our sound to go into the soul of the audience, and see if it can awaken some little thing in their minds...</string>
			<string>Pretty soon I believe people will have to rely on music to get some kind of peace of mind, or satisfaction, or direction...</string>
			<string>I try to get up everyday.</string>
			<string>Blues is easy to play, but hard to feel.</string>

		<array>
			<string>Puritanical attitudes die slowly.</string>
			<string>...to transcend the limitations of the body, you have to immerse yourself in it...</string>
			<string>If you reject your body, it becomes your prison cell.</string>
			<string>When sex involves all the senses intensely, it can be like a mystical experience...</string>
			<string>Sex can be a liberation. But it can also be an entrapment.</string>
			<string>Pain is meant to wake us up.</string>
			<string>Personal, private, solitary pain is more terrifying than what anyone else can inflict.</string>
			<string>People seek tyrants. They worship and support them.</string>
			<string>If natural energy and impulses are too severly suppressed for too long, they become violent.</string>
			<string>Violence isn&apos;t always evil. What&apos;s evil is the infatuation with violence.</string>
			<string>...we can only open the doors - we can&apos;t drag people through.</string>
			<string>...part of the disease is not being aware that we&apos;re diseased...</string>
			<string>Most people have no idea what they&apos;re missing.</string>
			<string>People are terrified to be set free - they hold on to their chains.</string>
			<string>It&apos;s strange that people fear death, the pain is over. Yeah, I guess it is a friend.</string>
			<string>People are taught that pain is evil and dangerous. How can they deal with love if they&apos;re afraid to feel?</string>
			<string>Feelings are disturbing.</string>
			<string>People talk about how great love is, but that&apos;s all bullshit. Love hurts.</string>
			<string>People are afraid of themselves - of their own reality - their feelings most of all.</string>
			<string>I obey the impulses everyone has, but won&apos;t admit to. By attacking me, punishing me, they can feel relieved of those impulses.</string>
			<string>I see the artist as shaman and scapegoat. People project their fantasies onto him and their fantasies come alive.</string>
			<string>We cripple ourselves with lies.</string>
			<string>Sex is full of lies... The body tries to tell the truth, but it&apos;s usually too battered with rules to be heard...</string>
			<string>It&apos;s all in how you carry it. That&apos;s what matters.</string>
			<string>You feel your strength in the experience of pain.</string>
			<string>People try to hide their pain, but they&apos;re wrong. Pain is something to carry...</string>
			<string>People cluster to TV, soap operas, movies, theatre, pop idols, and they have wild emotions over symbols, but in the reality of their own lives, they&apos;re emotionally dead.</string>
			<string>Twentieth Century culture&apos;s disease is the inability to feel the reality.</string>
			<string>TV is the invisible protective shield against bare reality.</string>
			<string>Americans are attached to violence. They attach themselves to processed violence, out of cans.</string>
			<string>America was conceived in violence...</string>
			<string>By yourself - for yourself. Each person for himself. If you want your true self to survive.</string>
			<string>Our culture mocks &apos;primitive cultures&apos; and prides itself on suppression of natural instincts and impulses.</string>
			<string>You imitate what you see.</string>
			<string>There are subtle ways to punish a person for daring to feel.</string>
			<string>Imprisonment begins with birth.</string>
			<string>You can take away a man&apos;s political freedom and you won&apos;t hurt him - unless you take away his freedom to feel. That can destroy him.</string>
			<string>There can&apos;t be any large-scale revolution until there&apos;s a personal revolution, on an individual level.</string>
			<string>You give up your ability to feel, and in exchange, put on a mask.</string>
			<string>The most important kind of freedom is to be what you really are.</string>
			<string>Expose yourself to your deepest fear. After that, fear has no power...</string>
			<string>I think people resist freedom because they&apos;re afraid of the unknown. But that unknown was once very well known - its where our souls belong.</string>
			<string>The love-street times are dead.</string>
			<string>If my poetry aims to achieve anything, it&apos;s to deliver people from the limited ways in which they see and feel.</string>

			<string>If I catch my opponents ever sleepin&apos;, I&apos;ll just slaughter &apos;em where they lie.</string>
			<string>The future to me is already a thing of the past.</string>
			<string>Behind every beautiful thing there&apos;s been some kind of pain...</string>
			<string>When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?</string>
			<string>I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity.</string>
			<string>Time is short and the days are sweet and passion rules the arrow that flies.</string>
			<string>I live in another world, where life and death are memorized.</string>
			<string>Yesterday&apos;s just a memory; tomorrow&apos;s never what it&apos;s supposed to be.</string>
			<string>Capitalism is above the law; it&apos;s said it don&apos;t count &apos;less it sells.</string>
			<string>Steal a little and they throw you in jail; steal a lot and they make you king.</string>
			<string>Sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace.</string>
			<string>Beauty walks a razor&apos;s edge, someday I&apos;ll make it mine.</string>
			<string>I paid the price of solitude but at least I&apos;m out of debt.</string>
			<string>...to live outside the law, you must be honest.</string>
			<string>Name me someone that&apos;s not a parasite and I&apos;ll go out and say a prayer for him.</string>
			<string>Your debutante knows what you need, but I know what you want.</string>
			<string>Somebody got lucky, but it was an accident.</string>
			<string>Here&apos;s your throat back, thanks for the loan.</string>
			<string>When you ain&apos;t got nothing, you got nothing to lose.</string>
			<string>You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend. When I was down, you just stood their grinning.</string>
			<string>Meanwhile, life outside goes on all around you.</string>
			<string>Money doesn&apos;t talk, it swears.</string>
			<string>You never ask questions when God&apos;s on your side...</string>
			<string>All the money you made will never buy back your soul.</string>
			<string>The cost of liberty is high...</string>
			<string>Who cares about the character? Just get up and act.</string>
			<string>We shouldn&apos;t confuse singers and performers with actors.</string>
			<string>I don&apos;t call myself a poet, because I don&apos;t like the word.</string>
			<string>You can&apos;t be wise and in love at the same time.</string>
			<string>I was born very far from where I&apos;m supposed to be, and so, I&apos;m on my way home, you know?</string>
			<string>I didn’t really have any ambition at all.</string>
			<string>Morality has nothing in common with politics.</string>
			<string>Many got it wrong and never did get it right. I went straight into it.</string>
			<string>The road out would be treacherous, and I didn’t know where it would lead but I followed it anyway.</string>
			<string>Sometimes you say things in songs even if there&apos;s a small chance of them being true.</string>
			<string>We may not be able to defeat these swine, but we don&apos;t have to join them.</string>
			<string>People today are still living off the table scraps of the sixties. They are still being passed around - the music and the ideas.</string>
			<string>I think of a hero as someone who understands the degree of responsibility that comes with his freedom.</string>
			<string>Chaos is a friend of mine.</string>
			<string>God, I&apos;m glad I&apos;m not me.</string>
			<string>Keep a good head and always carry a light bulb.</string>
			<string>A poem is a naked person... some people say I&apos;m a poet.</string>
			<string>There&apos;s no black and white, left and right to me anymore; there&apos;s only up and down and down is very close to the ground.</string>

			<string>I am no longer concerned with sensation and innovation, but with the perfection of my style.</string>
			<string>I have always believed that fashion was not only to make women more beautiful, but also to reassure them, give them confidence.</string>
			<string>The most beautiful makeup of a woman is passion. But cosmetics are easier to buy.</string>
			<string>I created for my era and I tried to foresee what tomorrow would be.</string>
			<string>The most beautiful clothes that can dress a woman are the arms of the man she loves.</string>
			<string>They are rare, those who imposed their style while fashion makers are so numerous.</string>
			<string>I participated in the transformation of my era. I did it with clothes, which is surely less important than music, architecture, painting... but whatever it&apos;s worth I did it.</string>
			<string>We must never confuse elegance with snobbery.</string>
			<string>Over the years I have learned that what is important in a dress is the woman who is wearing it.</string>
			<string>It pains me physically to see a woman victimized, rendered pathetic, by fashion.</string>
			<string>Isn&apos;t elegance forgetting what one is wearing?</string>
			<string>Fashion fades, style is eternal.</string>
			<string>Dressing is a way of life.</string>

		<array>
			<string>I was a rebellious child, a rebellious lover, a rebellious couturière — a real devil.</string>
			<string>Don&apos;t spend time beating on a wall, hoping to transform it into a door.</string>
			<string>Success is often achieved by those who don&apos;t know that failure is inevitable.</string>
			<string>Fashion is in the sky, in the street, fashion has to do with ideas, the way we live, what is happening.</string>
			<string>Nothing is ugly as long as it is alive.</string>
			<string>Fashion is architecture. It is a matter of proportions.</string>
			<string>Fashion is made to become unfashionable.</string>
			<string>Fashion is at once a caterpillar and a butterfly, caterpillar by day, butterfly by night.</string>
			<string>I have said that black has it all. White too. Their beauty is absolute. It is the perfect harmony.</string>
			<string>The best things in life are free. The second best are very expensive.</string>
			<string>Elegance is refusal.</string>
			<string>The best color in the whole world is the one that looks good on you.</string>
			<string>It is always better to be slightly underdressed.</string>
			<string>Gentleness doesn&apos;t get work done unless you happen to be a hen laying eggs.</string>
			<string>How many cares one loses when one decides not to be something but to be someone.</string>
			<string>Nature gives you the face you have at twenty. Life shapes the face you have at thirty. But at fifty you get the face you deserve.</string>
			<string>Since everything is in our heads, we had better not lose them.</string>
			<string>Men always remember a woman who caused them concern and uneasiness.</string>
			<string>A woman can be over dressed by never over elegant.</string>
			<string>You can be gorgeous at thirty, charming at forty, and irresistible for the rest of your life.</string>
			<string>A girl should be two things: who and what she wants.</string>
			<string>There is time for work. And time for love. That leaves no other time.</string>
			<string>Fashion changes, but style endures.</string>
			<string>I don&apos;t care what you think about me. I don&apos;t think about you at all.</string>
			<string>As long as you know men are like children, you know everything!</string>
			<string>I imposed black; it is still going strong today, for black wipes out everything else around.</string>
			<string>My life didn&apos;t please me, so I created my life.</string>
			<string>Dress shabbily and they remember the dress; dress impeccably and they remember the woman.</string>
			<string>Only those with no memory insist on their originality.</string>
			<string>I don&apos;t do fashion, I am fashion.</string>
			<string>You live but once; you might as well be amusing.</string>
			<string>In order to be irreplaceable, one must always be different.</string>
			<string>The most courageous act is still to think for yourself. Aloud.</string>
			<string>Some people think luxury is the opposite of poverty. It is not. It is the opposite of vulgarity.</string>

			<string>A shock electric - the night sustain&apos;d it...</string>
			<string>I celebrate myself, and sing myself, And what I assume you shall assume...</string>
			<string>The habit of giving only enhances the desire to give.</string>
			<string>The real artist is in humanity. What are called bad manners are often the most picturesque and significant of them all.</string>
			<string>If anything is sacred, the human body is sacred.</string>
			<string>I no doubt deserved my enemies, but I don&apos;t believe I deserved my friends.</string>
			<string>Behold, I do not give lectures or a little charity, When I give I give myself.</string>
			<string>Henceforth I ask not good fortune. I myself am good fortune.</string>
			<string>The greatest city is that which has the greatest men and women.</string>
			<string>Society waits unformed and is between things ended and things begun.</string>
			<string>I swear I think there is nothing but immortality!</string>
			<string>I see that I am to wait for what will be exhibited by death.</string>
			<string>What do you suppose will satisfy the soul except to walk free and own no superior?</string>
			<string>Peace is always beautiful.</string>
			<string>Liberty is to be subserved, whatever occurs.</string>
			<string>Give me the splendid silent sun, with all his beams full-dazzling!</string>
			<string>Thunder on! Stride on! Democracy. Strike with vengeful stroke!</string>
			<string>...Youth, full of grace, force, fascination! Do you know that Old Age may come after you, with equal grace, force, fascination?</string>
			<string>...Love like the light silently wrapping all.</string>
			<string>In the faces of men and women I see God.</string>
			<string>I have no mockings or arguments; I witness and wait.</string>
			<string>Nothing can happen more beautiful than death.</string>
			<string>None has begun to think how devine he himself is and how certain the future is.</string>
			<string>To have great poets, there must be great audiences too.</string>
			<string>Some people are so much sunlight to the square inch.</string>
			<string>We Americans have yet to really learn our own antecedents, and sort them, to unify them.</string>
			<string>What an awful thing war is! Mother, it hardly seems not men but a lot of devils and butchers butchering each other.</string>
			<string>...dismiss whatever insults your own soul...</string>
			<string>The poet shall not spend his time in unneeded work.</string>
			<string>...re-examine all you have been told at school or church or in any book...</string>
			<string>...go freely with powerful uneducated persons and with the young and with the mothers of families...</string>
			<string>...stand up for the stupid and crazy...</string>
			<string>He who does great deeds, does them from his innate sensitiveness to moral beauty.</string>
			<string>I think of few heroic actions, which cannot be traced to the artistical impulse.</string>
			<string>It is a beautiful truth that all men contain something of the artist in them.</string>

			<string>Anger as soon as fed is dead - &apos;Tis starving that makes it fat.</string>
			<string>My friends are my estate.</string>
			<string>A mother is one to whom you hurry when you are troubled.</string>
			<string>Dying is a wild night and a new road.</string>
			<string>Parting is all we know of heaven, and all we need of hell.</string>
			<string>Dwell in possibility.</string>
			<string>Morning without you is a dwindled dawn.</string>
			<string>Truth is so rare that it is delightful to tell it.</string>
			<string>Unable are the loved to die, for love is immortality.</string>
			<string>The possible&apos;s slow fuse is lit by the imagination.</string>
			<string>Luck is not chance, it&apos;s toil; fortune&apos;s expensive smile is earned.</string>
			<string>A wounded deer leaps the highest.</string>
			<string>We turn not older with years, but newer every day.</string>
			<string>Beauty is not caused. It is.</string>
			<string>Saying nothing... sometimes says the most.</string>
			<string>That it will never come again is what makes life sweet.</string>
			<string>Where thou art, that is home.</string>
			<string>Not knowing when the dawn will come, I open every door.</string>
			<string>Finite to fail, but infinite to venture.</string>
			<string>Forever is composed of nows.</string>

			<string>Afraid? Of whom am I afraid? Not death; for who is he?</string>
			<string>Look back on time with kindly eyes, He doubtless did his best...</string>
			<string>Hope is the thing with feathers that perches in the soul, and sings the tune without the words, and never stops at all...</string>

			<string>The Soul selects her own society.</string>
			<string>To live is so startling it leaves little time for anything else.</string>
			<string>The soul should always stand ajar. Ready to welcome the ecstatic experience.</string>
			<string>We meet no stranger, but Ourself.</string>
			<string>I took my power in my hand and went against the world...</string>

			<string>When I see a play and understand it the first time, then I know it can&apos;t be much good.</string>
			<string>People to whom nothing has ever happened cannot understand the unimportance of events.</string>
			<string>There is no method but to be very intelligent.</string>
			<string>The most important thing for poets to do is to write as little as possible.</string>
			<string>Let&apos;s not be narrow, nasty, and negative.</string>
			<string>Keep true, never be ashamed of doing right; decide on what you think is right and stick to it.</string>
			<string>...the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time.</string>
			<string>We shall not cease from exploration.</string>
			<string>You are the music while the music lasts.</string>
			<string>I think that what happens early on in life is that at a certain age one stands still and stagnates.</string>
			<string>...our lives are mostly a constant evasion of ourselves.</string>
			<string>...last year&apos;s words belong to last year&apos;s language; And next year&apos;s words await another voice.</string>
			<string>Anxiety is the hand maiden of creativity.</string>
			<string>Success is relative. It is what we make of the mess we have made of things.</string>
			<string>Where is the knowledge we have lost in information?</string>
			<string>Where is the Life we have lost in living?</string>
			<string>Genuine poetry can communicate before it is understood.</string>
			<string>If you aren&apos;t in over your head, how do you know how tall you are?</string>
			<string>What we call the beginning is often the end. And to make an end is to make a beginning. The end is where we start from.</string>
			<string>Sometimes things become possible if we want them bad enough.</string>
			<string>Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go.</string>

			<string>Trust thyself: every heart vibrates to that iron string.</string>
			<string>In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts: they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty.</string>
			<string>A man is a god in ruins.</string>
			<string>Every natural fact is a symbol of some spiritual fact.</string>
			<string>Beauty is the mark God sets upon virtue.</string>
			<string>Blessed are those who have no talent!</string>
			<string>I hate quotation. Tell me what you know.</string>
			<string>Poetry must be new as foam, and as old as the rock.</string>
			<string>It is easy to live for others; everybody does. I call on you to live for yourselves.</string>
			<string>The best effect of fine persons is felt after we have left their presence.</string>
			<string>Let me never fall into the vulgar mistake of dreaming that I am persecuted whenever I am contradicted.</string>
			<string>Children are all foreigners.</string>
			<string>Sometimes a scream is better than a thesis.</string>
			<string>We are always getting ready to live, but never living.</string>
			<string>The Religion that is afraid of science dishonours God and commits suicide.</string>
			<string>When a whole nation is roaring Patriotism at the top of its voice, I am fain to explore the cleanness of its hands and purity of its heart.</string>
			<string>To different minds, the same world is a hell, and a heaven.</string>
			<string>Respect the child. Be not too much his parent. Trespass not on his solitude.</string>
			<string>I wish not to concede anything to them, but to tame, drill, divide, and break them up, and draw individuals out of them.</string>
			<string>Masses are rude, lame, pernicious in their demands and influence, and need not be flattered, but to be schooled.</string>
			<string>People seem not to see that their opinion of the world is also confession of character.</string>
			<string>Money often costs too much.</string>

			<string>It is one of the greatest gifts you can give yourself, to forgive. Forgive everybody.</string>
			<string>Nothing will work unless you do.</string>
			<string>I love to see a young girl go out and grab the world by the lapels.</string>
			<string>Life&apos;s a bitch. You&apos;ve got to go out and kick some ass.</string>
			<string>Try to be a rainbow in someone&apos;s cloud.</string>
			<string>My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style.</string>
			<string>We delight in the beauty of the butterfly, but rarely admit the changes it has gone through to achieve that beauty.</string>
			<string>There is an African saying which is: Be careful when a naked person offers you a shirt.</string>
			<string>I do not trust people who don&apos;t love themselves and yet tell me, &apos;I love you.&apos;</string>
			<string>I&apos;ve learned that I still have a lot to learn.</string>
			<string>Hate, it has caused a lot of problems in the world, but has not solved one yet.</string>
			<string>I don&apos;t trust anyone who doesn&apos;t laugh.</string>
			<string>We need much less than we think we need.</string>
			<string>Love recognizes no barriers.</string>
			<string>Most people don&apos;t grow up. Most people age.</string>
			<string>No matter what happens, or how bad it seems today, life does go on, and it will be better tomorrow.</string>
			<string>You may not control all the events that happen to you, but you can decide not to be reduced by them.</string>
			<string>If I am not good to myself, how can I expect anyone else to be good to me?</string>
			<string>Never make someone a priority when all you are to them is an option.</string>
			<string>You can&apos;t use up creativity. The more you use, the more you have.</string>
			<string>I&apos;ve learned that making a &apos;living&apos; is not the same thing as &apos;making a life.&apos;</string>
			<string>...pursue the things you love doing and then do them so well that people can&apos;t take their eyes off you.</string>
			<string>You can only become truly accomplished at something you love. Don&apos;t make money your goal.</string>
			<string>If you don&apos;t like something, change it. If you can&apos;t change it, change your attitude. Don&apos;t complain.</string>
			<string>If I were a young person today, trying to gain a sense of myself in the world, I would do that again by reading...</string>
			<string>There is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you.</string>
			<string>I&apos;ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.</string>

			<string>A country is something that is built every day out of certain basic shared values.</string>
			<string>We aimed far and high, but we did not miss the mark.</string>
			<string>Some things I never learned to like. I didn&apos;t like to kiss babies, though I didn&apos;t mind kissing their mothers.</string>
			<string>I must say that &apos;Give Peace a Chance&apos; has always seemed to me to be sensible advice.</string>
			<string>Democracy demands that elected members be able to realize fully the role for which they have been chosen.</string>
			<string>Criminal law... cannot be based on the notion of sin; it is crimes that it must define.</string>
			<string>I believe a constitution can permit the co-existence of several cultures and ethnic groups with a single state.</string>
			<string>The essential ingredient of politics is timing.</string>
			<string>Our hopes are high. Our faith in people is great. Our courage is strong. And our dreams for this beautiful county will never die.</string>
			<string>If Canada is to survive, it can only survive in mutual respect and in love for one another.</string>
			<string>I&apos;ve been called worse things by better people.</string>
			<string>A society which emphasizes uniformity is one which creates intolerance and hate.</string>
			<string>What could be more absurd than the concept of an &apos;all Canadian&apos; boy or girl?</string>
			<string>Let us overthrow the totems, break the taboos. Or better, let us consider them cancelled. Coldly, let us be intelligent.</string>
			<string>It is our future in which we will find our greatness.</string>
			<string>The past is to be respected and acknowledged, but not to be worshipped.</string>
			<string>Liberalism is the philosophy for our time... because it is prepared to experiment and innovate and because it knows that the past is less important than the future.</string>
			<string>The attainment of a just society is the cherished hope of civilized men.</string>
			<string>There&apos;s no place for the state in the bedrooms of the nation.</string>

			<string>If everything was perfect, you would never learn and you would never grow.</string>
			<string>&apos;Power&apos; is not given to you. You have to take it.</string>
			<string>I don&apos;t want to be a hot girl. I want to be iconic.</string>
			<string>I can never be safe; I always try and go against the grain.</string>
			<string>As soon as I accomplish one thing, I just set a higher goal.</string>
			<string>I embrace mistakes, they make you who you are.</string>

			<string>...we have to teach our girls that they can reach as high as humanly possible.</string>
			<string>We have to teach our boys the rules of equality and respect, so that as they grow up gender equality becomes a natural way of life.</string>

			<string>Put on your sexy dress and move on.</string>
			<string>I can do what I want. I can say what I want. I can retire if I want. That&apos;s why I&apos;ve worked hard.</string>

			<string>We all have our imperfections.</string>
			<string>It&apos;s really about who you are, and the human being, that makes you beautiful.</string>
			<string>I have learned that it is no one else&apos;s job to take care of me but me.</string>
			<string>It is so liberating to really know what I want, what truly makes me happy, what I will not tolerate.</string>
			<string>I don&apos;t have to prove anything to anyone, I only have to follow my heart and concentrate on what I want to say to the world.</string>
			<string>I run my world.</string>
			<string>The reality is: sometimes you lose.</string>
			<string>...let&apos;s face it, money gives men the power to run the show.</string>
			<string>Women have to work much harder to make it in this world.</string>
			<string>We have to reshape our own perception of how we view ourselves.</string>
			<string>Why do you have to choose what type of woman you are? Why do you have to label yourself anything?</string>
			<string>I felt like it was time to set up my future, so I set a goal. My goal was independence.</string>

			<string>Make women rational creatures, and free citizens, and they will quickly become good wives; that is, if men do not neglect the duties of husbands and fathers.</string>
			<string>...what a weak barrier is truth when it stands in the way of an hypothesis!</string>
			<string>...wealth and female softness equally tend to debase mankind!</string>
			<string>...obeying a parent only on account of his being a parent, shackles the mind, and prepares it for a slavish submission to any power but reason.</string>
			<string>The two sexes mutually corrupt and improve each other.</string>
			<string>Men and women must be educated, in a great degree, by the opinions and manners of the society they live in.</string>
			<string>Situation seems to be the mould in which men&apos;s characters are formed.</string>
			<string>We reason deeply, when we forcibly feel.</string>
			<string>The same energy of character which renders a man a daring villain would have rendered him useful to society, had that society been well organized.</string>
			<string>Friendship and domestic happiness are continually praised; yet how little is there of either in the world...</string>
			<string>Without the aid of imagination all the pleasures of the senses must sink into grossness...</string>
			<string>Surely something resides in this heart that is not perishable, and life is more than a dream.</string>
			<string>A modest man is steady, a humble man timid, and a vain one presumptuous.</string>
			<string>It is justice, not charity, that is wanting in the world.</string>
			<string>Taught from their infancy that beauty is a woman&apos;s sceptre, the mind shapes itself to the body, and roaming round its gilt cage, only seeks to adorn its prison.</string>
			<string>Till women are more rationally educated, the progress of human virtue and improvement in knowledge must receive continual checks.</string>
			<string>Every political good carried to the extreme must be productive of evil.</string>
			<string>...my wayward heart creates its own misery - Why I am made thus I cannot tell...</string>
			<string>I am a strange compound of weakness and resolution!</string>
			<string>...true politeness is a polish, not a varnish...</string>
			<string>Virtue can only flourish amongst equals.</string>
			<string>No man chooses evil because it is evil; he only mistakes it for happiness, the good he seeks.</string>
			<string>You know I am not born to tread in the beaten track - the peculiar bent of my nature pushes me on.</string>
			<string>Nothing, I am sure, calls forth the faculties so much as the being obliged to struggle with the world...</string>

			<string>The abstract kills, the concrete saves.</string>
			<string>I desire the things which will destroy me in the end.</string>
			<string>I am made, crudely, for success.</string>
			<string>Perhaps when we find ourselves wanting everything, it is because we are dangerously near to wanting nothing.</string>
			<string>If I didn&apos;t think, I&apos;d be much happier...</string>
			<string>I want to express my being as fully as I can because I somewhere picked up the idea that I could justify my being alive that way.</string>
			<string>I am what I feel and think and do.</string>
			<string>Frustrated? Yes. Why? Because it is impossible for me to be God - or the universal woman-and-man - or anything much.</string>
			<string>The blood of love welled up in my heart with a slow pain.</string>
			<string>This second is life. And when it is gone it is dead.</string>
			<string>With me, the present is forever, and forever is always shifting, flowing, melting.</string>
			<string>After a heavy rainfall, poems titled RAIN pour in from across the nation.</string>
			<string>...you cannot regard your own life with objective curiosity all the time.</string>
			<string>I have to live my life, and it is the only one I&apos;ll ever have.</string>
			<string>My love&apos;s not impersonal yet not wholly subjective either.</string>
			<string>The blood jet is poetry, there is no stopping it.</string>
			<string>Perfection is terrible, it cannot have children.</string>
			<string>Out of the ash I rise with my red hair and I eat men like air.</string>
			<string>Dying is an art, like everything else.</string>
			<string>I took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart: I am, I am, I am.</string>
			<string>To the person in the bell jar, blank and stopped as a dead baby, the world itself is the bad dream.</string>
			<string>If neurotic is wanting two mutually exclusive things at one and the same time, then I&apos;m neurotic as hell.</string>
			<string>The one thing I was good at was winning scholarships and prizes, and that era was coming to an end.</string>
			<string>I thought how strange it had never occurred to me before that I was only purely happy until I was nine years old.</string>
			<string>What a man is is an arrow into the future and what a woman is is the place the arrow shoots from.</string>
			<string>If you expect nothing from somebody you are never disappointed.</string>
			<string>There must be quite a few things a hot bath won&apos;t cure, but I don&apos;t know many of them.</string>
			<string>We shall by morning inherit the earth. Our foot&apos;s in the door.</string>
			<string>What did my fingers do before they held him? What did my heart do, with its love?</string>
			<string>I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead; I lift my lids and all is born again.</string>
			<string>How frail the human heart must be - a mirrored pool of thought.</string>
			<string>I talk to God but the sky is empty.</string>
			<string>I want to live and feel all the shades, tones and variations of mental and physical experience possible in my life. And I am horribly limited.</string>

			<string>I hate tiny parties, they force one into constant exertion.</string>
			<string>The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it...</string>
			<string>Vanity working on a weak head, produces every sort of mischief.</string>
			<string>I do not want people to be very agreeable, as it saves me the trouble of liking them a great deal.</string>
			<string>It is very difficult for the prosperous to be humble.</string>
			<string>They are much to be pitied who have not been given a taste for nature early in life.</string>
			<string>Indulge your imagination in every possible flight.</string>
			<string>One cannot have too large a party.</string>
			<string>To sit in the shade on a fine day, and look upon verdure is the most perfect refreshment.</string>
			<string>One man&apos;s style must not be the rule of another&apos;s.</string>
			<string>Dress is at all times a frivolous distinction, and excessive solicitude about it often destroys its own aim.</string>
			<string>To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love.</string>
			<string>Without music, life would be a blank to me.</string>
			<string>The person, be it gentleman or lady, who has not pleasure in a good novel, must be intolerably stupid.</string>

			<string>There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends.</string>
			<string>Want for nothing but patience - or give it a more fascinating name: Call it hope.</string>
			<string>Know your own happiness.</string>
			<string>Suprises are foolish things. The pleasure is not enhanced, and the inconvenience is often considerable.</string>
			<string>One cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.</string>
			<string>I hate to hear you talk about all women as if they were fine ladies instead of rational creatures. None of us want to be in calm waters all our lives.</string>
			<string>Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance.</string>
			<string>Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then.</string>
			<string>Marriage is indeed a manoeuvring business.</string>
			<string>If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more.</string>
			<string>One half of the world cannot understand the pleasures of the other.</string>
			<string>No man is offended by another man&apos;s admiration of the woman he loves; it is the woman only who can make it a torment.</string>

			<string>Rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life.</string>
			<string>As is a tale, so is life: not how long it is, but how good it is, is what matters.</string>
			<string>...without ever committing an act of outright evil ourselves, we collude with it, through our own apathy.</string>
			<string>Those who choose not to empathize enable real monsters.</string>
			<string>Many prefer not to exercise their imaginations at all. They choose to remain comfortably within the bounds of their own experience...</string>
			<string>Had I really succeeded at anything else, I might never have found the determination to succeed in the one arena I believed I truly belonged.</string>
			<string>Talent and intelligence never yet inoculated anyone against the caprice of the Fates.</string>
			<string>...the moment you are old enough to take the wheel, responsibility lies with you.</string>
			<string>There is an expiry date on blaming your parents for steering you in the wrong direction...</string>
			<string>The stories we love best do live in us forever.</string>
			<string>We do not need magic to change the world, we carry all the power we need inside ourselves already: we have the power to imagine better.</string>
			<string>Unlike any other creature on this planet, humans can learn and understand, without having experienced. They can think themselves into other people&apos;s places.</string>
			<string>Climbing out of poverty by your own efforts, that is indeed something on which to pride yourself, but poverty itself is romanticized only by fools.</string>
			<string>Poverty entails fear, and stress, and sometimes depression; it means a thousand petty humiliations and hardships.</string>
			<string>...the true dilemmas of childhood are the dilemmas of the whole of life...</string>
			<string>Children are not &apos;they.&apos; They are us. </string>
			<string>I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any harm at all in allowing a kid to fantasize. In fact, I think to stop people from fantasizing is a very destructive thing indeed.</string>
			<string>Read anything you can get your hands on.</string>
			<string>I&apos;ve no idea where ideas come from and I hope I never find out...</string>
			<string>You control your own life. Your own will is extremely powerful.</string>
			<string>Whatever money you might have, self-worth really lies in finding out what you do best.</string>
			<string>Is &apos;fat&apos; really the worst thing a human being can be? Is &apos;fat&apos; worse than &apos;vindictive&apos;, &apos;jealous&apos;, &apos;shallow&apos;, &apos;vain&apos;, &apos;boring&apos; or &apos;cruel&apos;? Not to me.</string>

			<string>When the rich make war, it&apos;s the poor that die.</string>
			<string>If a victory is told in detail, one can no longer distinguish it from defeat.</string>
			<string>The best work is not what is most difficult for you; it is what you do best.</string>
			<string>The more one is absorbed in fighting evil, the less one is tempted to place the good in question.</string>
			<string>A man is what he wills himself to be.</string>
			<string>I refuse to let death hamper life. Death must enter life only to define it.</string>
			<string>We are in hell and I will have my turn!</string>
			<string>You are nothing other than your life.</string>
			<string>One always dies too soon - or too late. And yet, life is there, finished: the line is drawn, and it must all be added up.</string>
			<string>When I cannot see myself, even though I touch myself, I wonder if I really exist.</string>
			<string>Hell is other people.</string>
			<string>With despair, true optimism begins...</string>
			<string>...man must create his own essence: It is in throwing himself into the world, suffering there, struggling there, that he gradually defines himself.</string>
			<string>...each man must invent his own path.</string>
			<string>I have no need for good souls: an accomplice is what I wanted.</string>
			<string>Justice is a human issue, and I do not need a god to teach it to me.</string>
			<string>You must be afraid... That is how one becomes an honest citizen.</string>
			<string>Yes, I am so free. And what a superb absence is my soul.</string>
			<string>Do not judge the gods... they have painful secrets.</string>
			<string>Some men are born committed to action: they do not have a choice, they have been thrown on a path, at the end of that path, an act awaits them, their act.</string>
			<string>Fear? If I have gained anything by damning myself, it is that I no longer have anything to fear.</string>
			<string>It is certain that we cannot escape anguish, for we are anguish.</string>
			<string>Life has no meaning... It is up to you to give it a meaning, and value is nothing but the meaning that you choose.</string>
			<string>Man is condemned to be free; because once thrown into the world, he is responsible for everything he does.</string>
			<string>All human activities are equivalent... and... all are on principle doomed to failure.</string>
			<string>I am condemned to be free.</string>
			<string>Nothingness haunts being.</string>
			<string>You know, it&apos;s quite a job starting to love somebody.</string>
			<string>I construct my memories with my present.</string>
			<string>I hate victims who respect their executioners.</string>
			<string>Fascism is not defined by the number of its victims, but by the way it kills them.</string>

			<string>I want to put a ding in the universe.</string>
			<string>I&apos;m convinced that about half of what separates successful entrepreneurs from the non-successful ones is pure perseverance.</string>
			<string>I think if you do something and it turns out pretty good, then you should go do something else wonderful, not dwell on it for too long.</string>
			<string>Innovation is saying no to a thousand things.</string>
			<string>Being the richest man in the cemetery doesn&apos;t matter to me...</string>
			<string>You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart. </string>
			<string>Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.</string>
			<string>A lot of times, people don&apos;t know what they want until you show it to them.</string>
			<string>...expose yourself to the best things that humans have done and then try to bring those things into what you&apos;re doing.</string>
			<string>Ultimately, it comes down to taste.</string>
			<string>If you want to live your life in a creative way, as an artist, you have to not look back too much.</string>
			<string>Be a yardstick of quality. Some people aren&apos;t used to an environment where excellence is expected.</string>
			<string>As with all matters of the heart, you&apos;ll know when you find it.</string>
			<string>If you haven&apos;t found it yet, keep looking. Don&apos;t settle.</string>
			<string>Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work.</string>
			<string>You have to trust in something - your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.</string>
			<string>You can&apos;t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.</string>
			<string>Stay hungry. Stay foolish.</string>
			<string>It is better to be a pirate than to join the navy.</string>
			<string>...the ones who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do.</string>
			<string>Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.</string>
			<string>When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn&apos;t really do it, they just saw something.</string>
			<string>Creativity is just connecting things.</string>
			<string>Sometimes when you innovate, you make mistakes. It is best to admit them quickly, and get on with improving your other innovations.</string>
			<string>Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.</string>
			<string>Quality is much better than quantity. One home run is much better than two doubles.</string>
			<string>Just figure out what&apos;s next.</string>
			<string>...have the courage to follow your heart and intuition, they somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.</string>
			<string>Don&apos;t let the noise of other opinions drown out your own inner voice.</string>

			<string>If you can’t be better than your competition, just dress better.</string>
			<string>People respond well to people who are sure of what they want.</string>
			<string>It’s very important to take risks.</string>
			<string>It’s always about timing. If it’s too soon, no one understands. If it’s too late, everyone’s forgotten.</string>
			<string>People work much better when they have a real sense of responsibility.</string>
			<string>I recommend that you all get fired; it’s a great learning experience.</string>
			<string>There is a new kind of woman out there. She’s interested in business and money.</string>
			<string>I surround myself with a talented group of people that are opinionated and interesting.</string>
			<string>In the end, I respond to my own instincts.</string>
			<string>Fashion’s not about looking back. It’s always about looking forward.</string>
			<string>Fashion goes in only one direction – forward – and I am a firm believer in thinking that way too.</string>
			<string>Create your own style… let it be unique for yourself and yet identifiable for others.</string>
			<string>You either know fashion or you don&apos;t.</string>
			<string>If you look at any great fashion photograph out of context, it will tell you just as much about what&apos;s going on in the world as a headline in the New York Times.</string>
			<string>When I hear a company is being run by a team, my heart sinks. You need to have a leader with a vision and heart that can move things forward.</string>
			<string>The notion that a contemporary woman must look mannish in order to be taken seriously as a seeker of power is frankly dismaying. This is America, not Saudi Arabia.</string>
			<string>What people hate most is indecision. Even if I&apos;m completely unsure, I&apos;ll pretend I know exactly what I&apos;m talking about and make a decision.</string>
			<string>I wasn&apos;t academically successful. Maybe I&apos;ve spent a lot of my career trying to make up for that.</string>
			<string>If one comes across sometimes as being cold or brusque, it&apos;s simply because I&apos;m striving for the best.</string>

			<string>Animals outline their territories with their excretions, humans outline their territories by ink excretions on paper.</string>
			<string>Whatever the Thinker thinks, the Prover will prove.</string>
			<string>Pardon my levity, I don&apos;t see how to take death seriously. It seems absurd.</string>
			<string>I look forward without dogmatic optimism but without dread.</string>
			<string>I remain cheerful and unimpressed.</string>
			<string>I love you all and I deeply implore you to keep the lasagna flying.</string>
			<string>Each man spills the drink he loves.</string>
			<string>I don&apos;t know what anything &apos;is&apos;; I only know how it seems to me at this moment.</string>
			<string>&apos;Is,&apos; &apos;is.&apos; &apos;is&apos; - the idiocy of the word haunts me. If it were abolished, human thought might begin to make sense.</string>
			<string>The fallacy is that one can judge the part in isolation from the whole is &apos;the Lie that all men believe.&apos;</string>
			<string>Out of a meaningless and pointless existence, we have made meaning and purpose...</string>
			<string>There is absolutely nothing that can be taken for granted in this world.</string>
			<string>We are all absolutely free.</string>
			<string>There is no restraint that cannot be escaped.</string>
			<string>We live in an age of artificial scarcity, maintained by ignorance and fear.</string>
			<string>There are periods of history when the visions of madmen and dope fiends are a better guide to reality than the common-sense interpretation of...the so-called normal mind.</string>
			<string>The longer one is alone, the easier it is to hear the song of the earth.</string>
			<string>The devil is only a convenient myth invented by the real malefactors of our world.</string>
			<string>The Bible tells us to be like God, and then on page after page it describes God as a mass murderer.</string>
			<string>ONLY THE MADMAN IS ABSOLUTELY SURE.</string>
			<string>Once something becomes discernable, or understandable, we no longer need to repeat it. We can destroy it.</string>
			<string>Of course I&apos;m crazy, but that doesn&apos;t mean I&apos;m wrong.</string>
			<string>Most of our ancestors were not perfect ladies and gentlemen. The majority of them weren&apos;t even mammals.</string>
			<string>Mind is a tool invented by the universe to see itself; but it can never see all of itself...</string>
			<string>It only takes 20 years for a liberal to become a conservative without changing a single idea.</string>
			<string>I don&apos;t believe anything, but I have many suspicions.</string>
			<string>Horror is the natural reaction to the last 5,000 years of history.</string>
			<string>Everyone has a belief system, B.S., the trick is to learn not to take anyone&apos;s B.S. too seriously, especially your own.</string>
			<string>Beyond a certain point, the whole universe becomes a continuous process of initiation.</string>

			<string>If power asks why, then power is weakness.</string>
			<string>...in the absence of will power, the most complete collection of virtues and talents is wholly worthless.</string>
			<string>It is necessary, in this world, to be made of harder stuff than one&apos;s environment.</string>
			<string>The ordinary man looking at a mountain is like an illiterate person confronted with a Greek manuscript.</string>
			<string>My own plan is to swear off every kind of virtue, so that I triumph even when I fall!</string>
			<string>May the New Year bring you courage to break your resolutions early!</string>
			<string>Love is the law, love under will.</string>
			<string>I&apos;ve a strange feeling come over me - almost as if I were going to think!</string>
			<string>The Way of Mastery is to break all the rules - but you have to know them perfectly before you can do this; otherwise you are not in a position to transcend them.</string>
			<string>Since all things are God, in all things thou seest just so much of God as thy capacity affordeth thee.</string>
			<string>I was not content to believe in a personal devil and serve him, in the ordinary sense of the word. I wanted to get a hold of him personally and become his chief of staff.</string>
			<string>No one has yet invented a language from my point of view.</string>
			<string>I hardly ever talk - words seem such a waste, and they are none of them true.</string>
			<string>What the eye doesn&apos;t see, the heart doesn&apos;t grieve over.</string>
			<string>Every man and every woman is a star.</string>
			<string>...pure will, unassuaged of purpose, delivered from the lust of result, is every way perfect.</string>
			<string>I&apos;ve written this to keep from crying. But I am crying, only the tears won&apos;t come.</string>
			<string>I&apos;m a poet, and I like my lies the way my mother used to make them.</string>
			<string>Having to talk destroys the symphony of silence.</string>
			<string>Your kiss is bitter with cocaine.</string>
			<string>Science is always discovering odd scraps of magical wisdom and making a tremendous fuss about its cleverness.</string>
			<string>Ordinary morality is only for ordinary people.</string>
			<string>Magick is the science and art of causing change to occur in conformity with will.</string>
			<string>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</string>
			<string>The sin which is unpardonable is knowingly and willfully to reject truth, to fear knowledge lest that knowledge pander not to thy prejudices.</string>
			<string>The essence of independence has been to think and act according to standards from within, not without.</string>
			<string>If enough people come to agree with, and follow, the Rebel, we now have a Devil. Until, of course, still more people agree. And then, finally, we have - Greatness.</string>
			<string>Inevitably, anyone with an independent mind must become &apos;one who resists or opposes authority or established conventions&apos;: a rebel.</string>

			<string>Courage is what you earn when you&apos;ve been through the tough times and you discover they aren&apos;t so tough after all.</string>
			<string>There can be as much value in the blink of an eye as in months of rational analysis.</string>
			<string>When we become expert in something, our tastes grow more esoteric and complex.</string>
			<string>Cultural legacies are powerful forces. They have deep roots and long lives.</string>
			<string>Hard work is a prison sentence only if it does not have meaning.</string>
			<string>In the act of tearing something apart, you lose its meaning.</string>
			<string>Emotion is contagious.</string>
			<string>Caring about someone deeply is exhausting.</string>
			<string>To be someone&apos;s best friend requires a minimum investment of time. More than that, though, its takes emotional energy.</string>
			<string>No one who can rise before dawn three hundred and sixty days a year fails to make his family rich.</string>

			<string>I will never know how you see red and you will never know how I see it.</string>
			<string>To ask for an explanation is to explain the obscure by the more obscure.</string>

			<string>The purpose of a writer is to keep civilization from destroying itself.</string>
			<string>I may not have been sure about what really did interest me, but I was absolutely sure about what didn&apos;t.</string>
			<string>I opened myself to the gentle indifference of the world.</string>
			<string>At the heart of all beauty lies something inhuman.</string>
			<string>Always go too far, because that&apos;s where you&apos;ll find the truth.</string>
			<string>In order to understand the world, one has to turn away from it on occasion.</string>
			<string>Do not wait for the last judgement. It comes every day.</string>
			<string>People hasten to judge in order not to be judged themselves.</string>
			<string>Man is always prey to his truths. Once he has admitted them, he cannot free himself from them.</string>
			<string>In the midst of chaos, I found there was, within me, an invincible calm.</string>
			<string>There is not love of life without despair about life.</string>
			<string>Seeking what is true is not seeking what is desirable.</string>
			<string>Some people talk in their sleep. Lecturers talk while other people sleep.</string>
			<string>Without beauty, love, or danger it would almost be easy to live.</string>
			<string>What is a rebel? A man who says no.</string>
			<string>Freedom is nothing but a chance to be better.</string>
			<string>Since we&apos;re all going to die, it&apos;s obvious that when and how don&apos;t matter.</string>
			<string>If something is going to happen to me, I want to be there.</string>
			<string>You can&apos;t create experience, you undergo it.</string>
			<string>There is scarcely any passion without struggle.</string>
			<string>What is called a reason for living is also an excellent reason for dying.</string>
			<string>We are all special cases.</string>
			<string>Where there is no hope, it is incumbent on us to invent it.</string>
			<string>I rebel; therefore I exist.</string>
			<string>Beauty is unbearable, drives us to despair, offering us for a minute the glimpse of an eternity that we should like to stretch out over the whole of time.</string>
			<string>Fiction is the lie through which we tell the truth.</string>
			<string>Autumn is a second spring when every leaf is a flower.</string>
			<string>To be happy, we must not be too concerned with others.</string>
			<string>An intellectual is someone whose mind watches itself.</string>
			<string>Blessed are the hearts that can bend; they shall never be broken.</string>
			<string>Real generosity towards the future lies in giving all to the present.</string>
			<string>When I look at my life and its secret colors, I feel like bursting into tears.</string>
			<string>The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion.</string>
			<string>You know what charm is: a way of getting the answer yes without having asked any clear questions.</string>
			<string>Live to the point of tears.</string>
			<string>Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?</string>
			<string>Nobody realizes that some people expend tremendous energy merely to be normal.</string>
			<string>Man is the only creature who refuses to be what he is.</string>
			<string>In the depths of winter, I finally learned that within me there lay an invincible summer.</string>
			<string>You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life.</string>
			<string>You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of.</string>
			<string>Don&apos;t walk behind me; I may not lead. Don&apos;t walk in front of me; I may not follow. Just walk beside me and be my friend.</string>

			<string>Boldness has genius, power and magic in it!</string>
			<string>One ought, every day at least, to hear a little song, read a good poem, see a fine picture, and... speak a few reasonable words.</string>
			<string>As soon as you trust yourself, you will know how to live.</string>
			<string>...our planet is the mental institution of the universe.</string>
			<string>I bid the chords sweet music make, And all must follow in my wake.</string>
			<string>A man sees in the world what he carries in his heart.</string>
			<string>Know thyself? If I knew myself, I&apos;d run away.</string>
			<string>None are more hopelessly enslaved as those who falsely believe they are free.</string>
			<string>To think is easy. To act is hard. But the hardest thing in the world is to act in accordance with your thinking.</string>
			<string>Nothing shows a man&apos;s character more than what he laughs at.</string>
			<string>By seeking and blundering we learn.</string>
			<string>A person hears only what they understand.</string>
			<string>Life belongs to the living, and he who lives must be prepared for changes.</string>
			<string>Magic is believing in yourself, if you can do that, you can make anything happen.</string>
			<string>Things which matter most must never be at the mercy of things which matter least.</string>
			<string>I love those who yearn for the impossible.</string>
			<string>Nothing is worth more than this day.</string>
			<string>Knowing is not enough; we must apply. Willing is not enough; we must do.</string>
			<string>Instruction does much, but encouragement everything.</string>
			<string>Enjoy when you can, and endure when you must.</string>
			<string>All the knowledge I possess everyone else can acquire, but my heart is all my own.</string>
			<string>Age does not make us childish, as some say; it finds us true children.</string>
			<string>We are shaped and fashioned by what we love.</string>
			<string>Be bold and mighty forces will come to your aid.</string>
			<string>The greatest thing in this world is not so much where we stand as in what direction we are moving.</string>
			<string>We must always change, renew, rejuvenate ourselves; otherwise, we harden.</string>
			<string>Everything is hard before it is easy.</string>
			<string>We are our own devils; we drive ourselves out of our Edens.</string>
			<string>Divide and rule, a sound motto. Unite and lead, a better one.</string>
			<string>People who think honestly and deeply have a hostile attitude towards the public.</string>
			<string>If you don&apos;t feel it, you&apos;ll never get it.</string>
			<string>At the moment of commitment, the entire universe conspires to assist you.</string>
			<string>Talent develops itself in solitude; character in the stream of life.</string>
			<string>There is strong shadow where there is much light.</string>
			<string>Music is liquid architecture; Architecture is frozen music.</string>
			<string>If you would create something, you must be something.</string>
			<string>Dream no small dreams for they have no power to move the hearts of men.</string>
			<string>Difficulties increase the nearer we get to the goal.</string>
			<string>The soul that sees beauty may sometimes walk alone.</string>
			<string>We are never deceived; we deceive ourselves.</string>
			<string>Choose well, your choice is brief, and yet endless.</string>
			<string>God help us - for art is long, and life so short.</string>
			<string>We know accurately only when we know little, with knowledge doubt increases.</string>
			<string>Love does not dominate; it cultivates.</string>
			<string>There is nothing more dreadful than imagination without taste.</string>
			<string>Night is the other half of life, and the better half.</string>
			<string>The intelligent man finds almost everything ridiculous, the sensible man hardly anything.</string>
			<string>Doubt can only be removed by action.</string>
			<string>Too many parents make life hard for their children by trying, too zealously, to make it easy for them.</string>
			<string>The greatest evil that can befall man is that he should come to think ill of himself.</string>

			<string>Liberty of any kind is never lost all at once.</string>

			<string>I&apos;m a professional creative.</string>
			<string>I need to be able to give people more of what they want that is currently behind a glass.</string>
			<string>The passion is for people. The passion is for the 18-year-old version of myself. The passion is for the kids at my shows. I need to do more.</string>
			<string>The idea of Kanye and vanity are like, synonymous. But I&apos;ve put myself in a lot of places where a vain person wouldn&apos;t put themselves in. Like what&apos;s vanity about wearing a kilt?</string>
			<string>It&apos;s hard when people read things in a lot of different ways.</string>
			<string>I&apos;m the type of soul that likes to be in love and likes to be able to focus. And that inspires me.</string>
			<string>Any woman that you&apos;re in love with or that loves you is going to command a certain amount of, you know, energy. It&apos;s actually easier to focus, in some ways.</string>
			<string>Maybe 90% of the time it looks like I&apos;m not having a good time.</string>
			<string>I&apos;m always the one that&apos;s in a darker mood.</string>

			<string>I&apos;m forever the 35-year-old 5-year-old. I&apos;m forever the 5-year-old of something.</string>
			<string>Sometimes you don&apos;t even know when you&apos;re being compromised till after the fact, and that&apos;s what you regret.</string>
			<string>You know, even a Kanye West has compromised.</string>
			<string>I&apos;m like, the anti-celebrity, and my music comes from a place of being anti.</string>
			<string>I don&apos;t have some type of romantic relationship with the public.</string>
			<string>My message isn&apos;t perfectly defined. I have, as a human being, fallen to peer pressure.</string>
			<string>I don&apos;t have one regret.</string>
			<string>...when you say justice, it doesn&apos;t have to be war. Justice could just be clearing a path for people to dream properly.</string>
			<string>They&apos;ll take any shot possible to try to take away the power of my influence and my words. But the proof is in the work.</string>
			<string>I&apos;m like a broadcaster for futurism, for dreamers, for people who believe in themselves.</string>
			<string>We&apos;ve been taught since day one to stop believing in our own dreams.</string>
			<string>Laugh loud, please. Laugh until your lungs give out because I will have the last laugh.</string>
			<string>I need belief more than I need advice.</string>
			<string>It&apos;s not a matter of me believing in myself that&apos;s so scary to everyone, it&apos;s the idea of everyone else starting to believe in themselves just as much as I do that&apos;s scary.</string>
			<string>...the biggest slavery that we have is our opinion of ourselves.</string>
			<string>I&apos;m not saying that I&apos;m going to make a better world; I&apos;m just saying that I will provide some things that will help, and my glass ceiling that I&apos;m facing is based on my color.</string>
			<string>My mission is about what I want to create. It&apos;s for people, for humanity. It&apos;s about things that can make the world better.</string>
			<string>I just want to create more.</string>
			<string>...influence isn&apos;t my definition of success - it&apos;s a by-product of my creativity.</string>
			<string>...success, for me, is in having the ability to get my ideas out there.</string>
			<string>You know, becoming famous is like being catapulted into space - sometimes without a space suit.</string>
			<string>...when we talk about love, I don&apos;t have an answer. All I can say is that I&apos;m happy I have it.</string>
			<string>Love... Well, if someone has got all the money in the world, they&apos;d still want love.</string>
			<string>My type of bedtime stories dealt with things like the nose being knocked off the Sphinx...</string>
			<string>I want the power to create what is in my mind. That&apos;s my dream.</string>
			<string>I mean, look, it took some time for us to be comfortable with a walking, talking mouse, but that became an icon.</string>
			<string>I think there&apos;s something kind of depressing about a product being final, because the only time a product is really final is when you&apos;re in a casket.</string>
			<string>If the waves are high, then we&apos;re gonna have a fun day. If the waves are low, then you just stay on the beach.</string>
			<string>The risk for me would be in not taking one - that&apos;s the only thing that&apos;s really risky for me.</string>
			<string>Well, all we have is today. You know, the past is gone, and tomorrow is not promised.</string>
			<string>A lot of people are very scared with their ideas, and there is something to protecting yourself in that way...</string>
			<string>I&apos;m giving all that I have in this life.</string>
			<string>I try to get as close to a childlike level as possible because we were all artists back then.</string>
			<string>Our focus needs to be less on what our legacy&apos;s going to be or how we can control each other and more how we can give to each other.</string>
			<string>Every time I crash the Internet, it&apos;s like this little drop of truth.</string>
			<string>When humanity&apos;s gone, what do we give to this little planet that we&apos;re on, and what could we do collectively, removing the pride?</string>

			<string>I want to stay hopeful, even though I get scared about why we&apos;re even alive at all.</string>
			<string>I have a personal ambition to live my life honestly and honor the true love that I&apos;ve had and also the people I&apos;ve had around me.</string>
			<string>I&apos;m a very happy person, but life is hard sometimes, and relationships are shit sometimes.</string>
			<string>Having a simple career as a musician who liked music was good enough for me.</string>
			<string>I knew that it takes getting everything you ever wanted and then losing it to know what true freedom is.</string>
			<string>Feeling like you&apos;re respected among the people who do the same thing you do is incredible and necessary.</string>
			<string>Do you know what makes you stronger? When people treat you and your art with dignity.</string>
			<string>Read books, pick your role models wisely. Find out what they did and do it.</string>
			<string>I used to wonder if it was God&apos;s plan that I should be alone for so much of my life. But I found peace.</string>
			<string>Live fast. Die young. Be wild. Have fun.</string>
			<string>I was always an unusual girl. My mother told me I had a chameleon soul...</string>
			<string>Are you in touch with all of your darkest fantasies? Have you created a life for yourself where you can experience them?</string>
			<string>When you&apos;re an introvert like me and you&apos;ve been lonely for a while, and then you find someone who understands you, you become really attached to them. It&apos;s a real release.</string>
			<string>I love going to the ocean. I love driving. I love going to shows. Just being with people I really have fun with.</string>
			<string>I love the summer. I&apos;m happy in the summer.</string>
			<string>I sort of have an affinity for really good, strong, self-assured people.</string>
			<string>...I have success because I&apos;m at peace and I&apos;m a good person in my everyday life and that&apos;s important.</string>
			<string>It&apos;s not nice to live in fear. That&apos;s part of the goal. Not being afraid of what&apos;s happening to you.</string>
			<string>Creatively I&apos;m in charge, if I wasn&apos;t, I would stop.</string>
			<string>I sort of do what I say and say what I do which I&apos;m happy with because it makes my life real easy.</string>
			<string>I believe nothing happens by mistake. You know, the universe has a divine plan.</string>
			<string>Curiosity is good.</string>
			<string>When you love your child, you don&apos;t know what to do with someone who wants to do what no one else does successfully.</string>
			<string>I was always a singer, it was nothing anyone planned on me doing for real, because it&apos;s an unusual thing.</string>
			<string>I was a different sort of child, as half the children are.</string>
			<string>Everything else is so hard; hopefully love is the one thing that is actually fun.</string>
			<string>If people come and see you at a show for 80 minutes they literally know everything about you.</string>
			<string>I relate to being the person who people come to for &apos;such a change from the old routine,&apos; but not being the main thing.</string>
			<string>It&apos;s a shame about the health consequences because a lot of great things happen over a coffee and a cigarette.</string>
			<string>If there&apos;s a physicality and a chemistry, that ends up winning for me every time because it&apos;s the opposite of what I have every day.</string>
			<string>I like a tangible, passionate love. For me, if it isn&apos;t physical, I&apos;m not interested.</string>
			<string>I like that two worlds can live in one.</string>
			<string>My goal is to be a good person who lives with dignity and grace.</string>

			<string>The day I wake up without cellulite? Now that would be the perfect day.</string>
			<string>I have friends from rock stars to Rastas; I don&apos;t even know what an unexpected friend is at this point.</string>
			<string>The way I dress depends on how I feel. I never have to psych myself up. Usually it just feels like it works.</string>
			<string>I am very ambitious! It&apos;s ridiculous how much I want to put on my plate, which is already full.</string>
			<string>...I tend to be more sensitive toward others and what they&apos;re going through. I don&apos;t know if that&apos;s the healthiest thing, but it&apos;s the truth.</string>
			<string>When you give God complete control, it&apos;s very hard not to be fearless.</string>
			<string>I try my best to avoid the sharks of life, but I have had my share of experiences with them, and in those cases I just have to handle them accordingly.</string>
			<string>Fashion is a clear indication, a way to express your attitude, your mood.</string>
			<string>When it feels like it&apos;s yours and it feels like it&apos;s you, that&apos;s what works.</string>
			<string>...a lot of the decisions I make, a lot of the direction I want to move, is against the grain, or against society&apos;s tight lane...</string>
			<string>You will never be stylish if you don&apos;t take risks.</string>
			<string>I love singing. I love it, and it doesn&apos;t feel like a chore. It&apos;s an expression.</string>
			<string>I never wanted to be famous. I just wanted my music to be heard all over the world.</string>
			<string>Fuck bitches, get money!</string>
			<string>The life of Rihanna is pretty fuckin&apos; awesome.</string>
			<string>Music is like shopping for me. Every song is like a new pair of shoes.</string>
			<string>I&apos;m crazy, and I don&apos;t pretend to be anything else.</string>
			<string>I like to take charge, but I love to be submissive.</string>
			<string>It&apos;s 4:20 somewhere.</string>
			<string>Seriously, all I want is a guy to take me out and make me laugh for a good hour and take my ass back home.</string>
			<string>If I dress too sexy, then I&apos;m a slut; if I dress sophisticated, then I&apos;m a grandma. At the end of the day, I just wear what I want to wear.</string>
			<string>...if I want to wear it, I will.</string>
			<string>For me, it&apos;s tougher to be vulnerable than to be tough.</string>
			<string>My first kiss was in high school, and it was the worst thing ever.</string>
			<string>I&apos;m waiting for the man who&apos;s ballsy enough to deal with me.</string>
			<string>To me, sex is power. It&apos;s empowering when you do it because you want to do it.</string>
			<string>I had to fake it till I made it.</string>
			<string>...I&apos;m not gonna ever crash. I&apos;m in control.</string>
			<string>I&apos;m open to love. But guys should have to earn it.</string>
			<string>I want to be the black Madonna.</string>
			<string>Alcohol is the devil and I need Chinese food.</string>
			<string>I never know what day it is. Never, ever, ever.</string>

			<string>A lot of the time you walk in a room they already know what they want to write about you.</string>
			<string>Actors do like watching girls parade down the runway for some reason.</string>
			<string>When people see an actor speak, they think they know him or her, whereas I&apos;m just a face or a body to them.</string>
			<string>Americans are really obsessed with their teeth being white and straight, aren&apos;t they?</string>
			<string>I feel like I&apos;m being judged a lot of the time.</string>
			<string>You should always be asleep on a plane.</string>
			<string>It&apos;s all about the blanket. Blanket, pillow, and red wine.</string>
			<string>It is quite amazing what I didn&apos;t feel after a while. I didn&apos;t really want to feel things.</string>
			<string>I thought it was quite vain to say, I want to be a model.</string>
			<string>I want to live my life in a way that when I get really old, I look back at my life and say: aaah I lived it, not survived it.</string>
			<string>People think your success is just a matter of having a pretty face. But it&apos;s easy to be chewed up and spat out.</string>
			<string>You&apos;ve got to stay ahead of the game to be able to stay in it.</string>
			<string>I have met almost everyone I&apos;ve wanted to meet.</string>
			<string>I thought we might all burst into flames, all the crap we&apos;ve done.</string>
			<string>I&apos;m not going to be horrible just for the sake of having attitude or make other people feel small just to make me feel bigger.</string>
			<string>I don&apos;t want people to know what is true all the time and that&apos;s what keeps the mystery.</string>
			<string>I&apos;ve been blamed for everything, from smoking to heroin to anorexia.</string>
			<string>I didn&apos;t like my teeth. I didn&apos;t like my flat chest, either.</string>
			<string>It was kind of boring for me to have to eat.</string>
			<string>I don&apos;t like doing pictures as myself. I like to be made into someone else.</string>
			<string>Never complain. Never explain.</string>
			<string>Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels.</string>
			<string>People don&apos;t hear me talk. They don&apos;t expect me to.</string>
			<string>I like feeling that I&apos;ve nailed it, and we&apos;ve got the picture.</string>
			<string>I have made some of the best friends that I&apos;ve got in this business.</string>
			<string>It sounds really corny but I think if you&apos;re beautiful inside it shows on the outside, for sure.</string>
			<string>You can&apos;t do a dog in a heel.</string>
			<string>I got tired of feeling like Dracula. I wanted to see some daylight, and not just at six o&apos;clock in the morning.</string>
			<string>I haven&apos;t partied since... last Friday!</string>
			<string>It&apos;s a sin to be tired.</string>
			<string>Going to the gym wouldn&apos;t be on my list of favorite things to do.</string>
			<string>I never did a dirty armpit. You can look dirty, but you can&apos;t be dirty.</string>
